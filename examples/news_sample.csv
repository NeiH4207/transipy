34656, A baby died at an unnamed medical facility because its parents refused to allow a black nurse to care for the child.,"November 10, 2015","Fellow Twitter users suggested @FierceFemtivist indicated she was from Louisville, Kentucky, prior to deleting her account. We were unable to locate any news reports of unusual infant deaths on 8 November 2015 in that area, nor were we able to confirm that the purported incident took place in Louisville (or at all):",Kim LaCapria,"On 8 November 2015, former Twitter user @FierceFemtivist published an alarming series of tweets about purportedly racist parents who allowed their child to die rather than be treated by “n***** nurses.” The tweets in question, besides appearing on Twitter (cached partially here), were circulated via Facebook and Tumblr and are embedded in full below. According to @FierceFemtivist, she “just had an infant die” that she personally “could’ve saved” because the child’s epithet-slinging, Confederate flag-bedecked father purportedly physically blocked the nurse from entering the baby’s room despite the fact that the infant was “crashing fast.” @FierceFemtivist claimed to be the most qualified caregiver in the facility but did not provide a date, facility name, medical condition, nor even a gender for the baby who purportedly died solely because it had racist parents. The child appeared merely as a footnote to the narrative of neatly-packaged racism, replete with a Confederate-flag wearing, stock redneck character. Even after the baby’s preventable death, @FierceFemtivist described its parents as unmoved by grief and simply concerned with whether a black staff member might handle the infant’s corpse. No response on the part of the hospital or other medical staffers during the critical event was described in the story; as presented, the narrative reads like the facility passively allowed a baby to die during an unspecified cardiac event for the sole reason that the parents objected to a nurse’s race (despite the fact that hospitals and Child Protective Services maintain broad protocols for such emergency interventions). The form of sure life-saving care which could only have been be rendered by that one nurse (and apparently no other on-duty caregivers) wasn’t specified in the account. Readers were left with a number of questions when @FierceFemtivist deleted her account (and along with it, the controversial tweets). Did the incident occur on 8 November 2015, the date the tweets were posted, or earlier? Where was the facility located? Why did no other nurses or doctors intervene and attempt to administer life-saving care, even if they weren’t as capable of doing so? Were police summoned to investigate the baby’s death? What was the condition and ultimate cause of death? Was the baby male or female? Were any adults (parents or medical staff) considered potentially liable for the purported death?","http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ayn0Ddl2o8sJ:https://twitter.com/fiercefemtivist+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us, http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/6/1385, http://seananmcguire.tumblr.com/post/132867210710/feelingwomanish-vngelichoe-he-didnt-want-a, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2015/11/fiercefemtivist10.jpg",unproven,"Politics, fiercefemtivist, racism"

29558,Germany has banned pork from school canteens because it offends Muslim 'migrants.',"March 7, 2016","What's true: Some politicians complained that less pork was being served in Germany, diluting the country's culinary cultural heritage. What's false: Germany has banned pork in any way, shape, or form.",Kim LaCapria,"On 7 March 2016, British tabloid Express reported that some German cafes and schools were phasing out pork products. The headline (“GERMANY BANS SAUSAGES”) naturally made some readers infer that the country had banned pork entirely. The article itself described a less alarming scenario, in which a single politician said that pork was slowly disappearing from schools and cafeterias, and extrapolating that it was because Muslims were possibly objecting to its presence: SCHOOLS and canteens in Germany have BANNED pork from their menus over fears of offending Muslim migrants, a top politician has revealed. An increasing number of public canteens, child daycare centres and schools have stopped serving sausages, bacon and ham over religious considerations. Now members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party are fighting to keep pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of German culture. Daniel Günther, party representative, claimed that pork products were being taken off the menu in schools, nurseries and canteens across the country. He said: “The protection of minorities – including for religious reasons – must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration. The paper surmised such a “move” would deepen resentment over immigration in Germany, without specifying precisely what, exactly, was moving: The move is likely to cause tensions among residents who support the introduction of restrictions on the inflow of refugees to the country. At around the same time, readers also asked about a Daily Mail piece making a similar claim about pork, reporting that schools in a locality in England (not Germany) were replacing pork with “halal meat”: Parents have condemned a school’s decision to ban all pork products from the menu and replace other meats with halal versions. Pupils aged between three and 11 at Brinsworth Manor Infant and Junior Schools in Rotherham – which Ofsted identifies as having only a small number of pupils from minority ethnic groups – will no longer be able to enjoy sausages, bacon or ham. Parents at both schools, which share a site, were told of the decision in a letter from Rotherham Council’s principal catering officer Ron Parry, who wrote that there had been ‘minor adjustments’ to the lunch menu. While many thought this article came out around the same time as the Germany one, it was actually already two years old (from 7 March 2014), and concerned one particular area in England, not Germany. That story also contained the following reportage, which appeared to partially contradict its initial claims: The school governors at both schools are understood to have agreed to the menu change to ensure the meals are more inclusive. A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council confirmed that school meals at both Brinsworth Manor schools have changed and now include halal and non-halal meat on the menu. She added that the Schools Catering Service supplies about 17,000 school meals every day to children at infant, junior, primary and secondary schools in Rotherham. She said: ‘The provision of both halal and non-halal is not unusual in Rotherham’s school. Currently, nine schools out of 115, select one of our menus that provide a mix of both halal and non-halal meals. ‘All meat on our menus, including halal, is sourced from reputable companies, which fully comply with the quality standards of the relevant individual meat boards.’ At any rate, the “pork ban” didn’t last even last until the end of March 2014; it was soon reversed, mostly due to pressure by far-right and nationalist political groups. On 1 March 2016, news outlet Deutsche Welle covered the matter of Germany’s vanishing pork. According to that report, politician Daniel Günther had complained about what he perceived as a decreased number of pork-based items on cafeteria menus: CDU parliamentary group leader, Daniel Günther, bemoaned on Tuesday that an increasing number of canteens, nurseries and schools are removing pork from their menu due to religious considerations. “The protection of minorities – including for religious reasons – must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration,” Günther said, arguing that tolerance also means “the appreciation and sufferance of other food cultures and lifestyles.” Günther told local German newspaper “Lübecker Nachrichten” that at least one nursery in every voting district had stopped serving pork after taking Muslim children into consideration. “The consumption of pork belongs to our culture,” he argued, adding that those who didn’t want to eat pork didn’t have to. “No one should be obliged to do so,” he said. “But we also don’t want the majority having to refrain from pork.” Deutsche Welle also provided more contextual information. According to its article, many Germans mocked the initiative and felt it was completely without merit: The CDU’s proposal was met with a wave of mockery on Tuesday, particularly on Twitter where the hashtag #schweinefleischpflicht – meaning “pork duty” – became Germany’s top trending hashtag by late Tuesday afternoon. Accompanied with an image with the words “Wurst case scenario” – wurst being the German word for sausage – Germany’s Green party tweeted: “Now we finally know what the CDU meant with dominant culture.” The WWF in Berlin also criticized the CDU proposal. “At present there is little evidence that the pork cutlet and chop must be placed on the menus of German canteens as a protected species,” the wildlife protection organization quipped. The exaggerated claims about pork bans in Germany weren’t the first of their kind to appear in British media sources. An October 2015 press frenzy centered around purported bans on pork in UK offices (nothing was banned), and in June 2015 the Daily Mail claimed Muslims demanded someone’s grandfather be exhumed (again, false). In 2014 claims circulated that KFC banned hand wipes because they were prohibited by Islam (they weren’t), and around the same time a questionable story made the rounds about a couple booted from a bus for offending Muslims by singing the theme song to Peppa Pig. While it was true one or (at most) a few German politicians “bemoaned” what they believed was a disappearing presence of pork in school cafeterias, misleading headlines indicated that there was a “ban on pork”. Finally, a number of Germans mocked the assertions as ludicrous and baseless.","http://bnp.org.uk/news/regional/bnp-victory-brinsworth-rotherham, http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/peppapig.asp, http://www.snopes.com/dead-grandfather-offends-muslims/, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2575724/Parents-fury-pork-sausages-banned-school-menu-replaced-halal-meat.html, http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/kfcwipes.asp, http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/650246/Germany-bans-pork-cafes-schools-offending-Muslim-migrants, http://www.dw.com/en/schleswig-holstein-cdu-fights-to-keep-pork-on-canteen-menus/a-19085870, http://www.snopes.com/offices-ban-pork-muslims/",false,Politics
8416,Coronavirus prompts Canada to roll out safe drugs for street users.,"April 16, 2020","Canada’s Pacific province of British Columbia was already battling an opioid epidemic when the new coronavirus hit, compounding the threat to drug users, many of whom are homeless and particularly vulnerable during the pandemic.",Tessa Vikander,"In March, the Canadian government urged provinces to lower barriers to prescription medications - allowing doctors to provide prescriptions for controlled substances by phone and  pharmacists to deliver them - to better help citizens to practice physical distancing and self-isolation. B.C. is the first province to apply those guidelines to support people who use street drugs. Healthcare providers are  ramping up the supply of prescription drug replacements for those who live with addictions to drugs like heroin, and even dispensing some of them via unique vending machines. “We’ve taken these exemptions and we’re running with them at break-neck speed,” said Judy Darcy, provincial Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. The goal is to “bring down the number of people who are dying of overdose,” she said. The Downtown Eastside is where the majority of Vancouver’s homeless population resides. In 2019, the city had 2,223 homeless residents, about a third of whom live with opioid or methamphetamine addictions. By providing a safe supply of legal drug alternatives, the province hopes to lower a sudden spike in drug overdose deaths that coincided with the coronavirus outbreak in Vancouver. Overdose deaths in the city had been declining over the  past year with implementation of safe consumption sites and availability of naloxone overdose reversal kits. But between March 23 and 29, police in Vancouver responded to eight suspected overdose deaths, the most in a single week since August 2019. The following week, they attended eight more. Cheyenne Johnson, co-interim executive director at the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, said the region’s illicit drug supply was already tainted. The coronavirus closure of the border with the United States has exacerbated the problem by stymying illegal drug supply routes, prompting dealers to increasingly make or cut their wares with dangerous ingredients. “As the effects of the pandemic continue to unfold, the illicit drug supply is likely to become significantly more adulterated and toxic,” Johnson said. Before the new guidelines came into place, some people were able to access prescription drug replacements through special programs. In most instances, they had to get the medication from a pharmacy every day. For people using the highly potent opioid fentanyl or heroin on the street, doctors can provide the prescription opioid hydromorphone along with methadone. Dexedrine or Ritalin are  available to people who would otherwise be using cocaine or crystal meth. Days after the new guidelines were rolled out, Rupinder Brar, a physician at Vancouver’s Portland Hotel Society, said she has provided prescriptions for free drug replacements, which can be dispensed by the week. This gives her patients “a fighting chance” as supplies of illicit street drugs dwindle, along with sharply reduced opportunities to make income at a time of coronavirus shutdowns and social distancing measures. “I don’t want them to have to go to the pharmacy every day,” Brar said. Another option are specialized vending machines called MySafe. Conceived in response to the opioid crisis, they dispense drug replacements with a prescription, bypassing the need for a face-to-face interaction with a pharmacist. At the corner of Vancouver’s Main and Hastings streets, a typically busy intersection in a neighborhood where hawking pills is common, some sections of the sidewalk were virtually empty in early April. Chrissy McMullin, a Downtown Eastside resident who uses drugs, already takes opioid replacements and said she had no trouble getting a hydromorphone prescription under the new guidelines. McMullin, who lost her brother in October to an overdose, is upset it took a global pandemic to prompt access to safe drugs. “It’s a real kick in the gut, to see how quickly and easily (it got put in place),” McMullin said. “Now all of a sudden what we’ve been trying to get for years is made available.”"," ",true,Health News

They say controlled blazes help increase nutrient availability in the forest and remove some leaf litter and smaller trees and brush. That, in turn, allows more sunlight to reach the forest floor to regenerate oak and hickory trees and sun-loving plants. Officials say 1,710 acres are scheduled for controlled burns during March, April and May on the southern Ohio forest’s Ironton Ranger District.

8602,"School closures will have little impact on COVID-19 control, review finds.","April 6, 2020","School closures do not tend to help contain the spread of infections during outbreaks of disease such as COVID-19, but will have a big impact on how societies restart after lockdown, scientists said on Monday.",Kate Kelland,"Data on the effects of school closures on COVID-19 are limited as the pandemic is still under way, but researchers at University College London said evidence from flu epidemics and outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses suggests their impact on the spread of the disease will be small. “We know from previous studies that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility and attack rates are higher in children. This is the opposite of COVID-19,” said Russell Viner, an expert at UCL’s Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health who co-led the research. “Policymakers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19 given the profound and long lasting effect they will have on children - particularly the most disadvantaged,” he said. Millions of children around the world have been affected by school closures as governments introduced social distancing and lockdown measures to try to slow the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new SARS-COV2 coronavirus. Viner’s research, published late on Monday in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal, said that as of March 18, some 107 countries had implemented national schools closures. To analyze the potential impact, Viner’s team reviewed 16 previous studies, including nine which looked at school closures during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus similar to the one that causes COVID-19. Data from the SARS outbreak in China, Hong Kong and Singapore suggested school closures “did not contribute to control of the epidemic”, they said in a summary of the review. Experts not directly involved in the research said its findings were important and confirmed what many suspected: That the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs for affected children and families. “This work suggests that ... schools could, and should, begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through,” said Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Britain’s Nottingham Trent University. Viner said the findings suggest countries should now “ask hard questions about when and how to open schools”. He said other measures, such as staggering school start and break times, closing school playgrounds and minimising the movement of children between classes could be considered to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading."," ",true,Health News
27556,"The state of Michigan threatened local beavers with a $10,000 per day fine for failing to remove their dams.","August 24, 2000","After some wrangling the agency ultimately dropped the issue, but not before Stephen Tvedten found an inventive way of quickly pointing out both how ludicrous and humorous the situation was. In a way dusty legal language never could, such a letter serves to drive home the silliness of Michigan DEQ’s intractable posturing. The beavers are likely still ignorant of how close they came to being fined $10,000 a day for dam living expenses.",David Mikkelson,"In July 1997, one of Stephen Tvedten’s neighbors noticed flooding on his property and traced it back to a dam on Tvedten’s stream. The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on 28 July 1997, and five months later the agency responded with a letter to the offending land owner. The letter, from David Price, a local Michigan DEQ official, was blunt: The “construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond” was “unauthorized” because “a permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.” The letter ordered Stephen Tvedten, the land owner, to “cease and desist” under penalty of “elevated enforcement action”:  STATE OF MICHIGAN Reply to: GRAND RAPIDS DISTRICT OFFICE STATE OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR 350 OTTAWA NW GRAND RAPIDS MI 49503-2341 JOHN ENGLER, Governor DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HOLLISTER BUILDING, PO BOX 30473, LANSING MI 48909-7973 INTERNET: http://www.deq.state.mi RUSSELL J. HARDING, Director  December 17, 1997  CERTIFIED  Mr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339  Dear Mr. DeVries:  SUBJECT: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023-1 T11N, R10W, Sec. 20, Montcalm County  It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property. You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity:  Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity. A review of the Department’s files show that no permits have been issued. Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations. We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted. The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff. Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action. We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter. Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions. Sincerely,  David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division  Mr. Tvedten responded to the Michigan DEQ’s demand with the now widely-circulated “dam letter,” in which he pointed out that the “debris dams” he had been ordered to remove because they were constructed without permission from the state of Michigan were actually built by beavers:  Dear Mr. Price: Re: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm County  Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to. You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses. You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response. First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan — I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood “debris” dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for, nor authorize, their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials “debris.” I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic. As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request? If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits. Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. My first concern is — aren’t the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation? The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation — so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department’s dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling them dam names. If you want the dam stream “restored” to a dam free-flow condition — contact the dam beavers — but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) — be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first. As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders. If you want to hurt these dam beavers — be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State — I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy, or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice! In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green, and water flows downstream. They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond. So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now. Why wait until 1/31/98? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then. In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem: bears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone. If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! (The bears are not careful where they dump!) Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely, Stephen L. Tvedten  The DEQ later claimed they were fully aware the “debris dams” were beaver dams; the issue, they said, was that the beavers who built them had long since abandoned the dams, but Mr. Tvedten had been continuing to maintain and even build up the dams himself:  The letter concerned an enforcement action directed to a tenant on property surrounding Spring Pond, which is located in Pierson Township, Montcalm County, Michigan. The tenant was observed by the downstream complainant, and has since admitted to the complainant, that he artificially built up, and maintained two abandoned beaver dams on the discharge end of the natural pond. Such an activity falls under the jurisdiction of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1194 PA 451, as amended. It is the Department’s position that in the absence of any threat to public welfare, beaver dams should be left in their natural state, that being either actively maintained or abandoned by beaver. The Department conducted an on-site inspection of the dams in August of 1997, accompanied by a Department of Natural Resources fisheries biologist, the Pierson Township Supervisor and the complainant. The tenant’s actions, and a threat to the welfare of the downstream complainant prompted our correspondence of December 1997, instructing the tenant to cease and desist all illegal activity and to restore the stream to its prior condition. The owner of the property took issue with our action, and responded with his own version of the situation. It was this correspondence that has been circulating in the internet. Luis Saldivia Grand Rapids District Supervisor Land and Water Management Division 616-356-0208  For his part, Mr. Tvedten claimed that the dams had been “abandoned” because a neighbor had killed the beavers (then filed a complaint with the state because he was concerned that the untended dams would break apart and enter his property) and that no one but the beavers had ever maintained them. And contemporaneous accounts of the brouhaha quoted a Michigan DEQ spokesman as saying the agency hadn’t performed an inspection before firing off their December 1997 letter to Mr. Tvedten:  Ken Silfven, public information officer at the state Department of Environmental Quality, said that … the account was correct. He hastened to note, however, that the case was prompted by a complaint from a neighbor who was concerned about flooding caused by the dams. The department dropped its investigation after an inspection by a DEQ employee. “It probably would have been a good idea to do the inspection before we sent the notice,” Silfven said."," ",true,"Humor, Loony Letters"
2830,More infected in fresh wave of China bird flu - WHO.,"January 20, 2014","Another 23 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu in recent days, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday, adding to at least 24 new cases last week and confirming a fresh surge in the virus.",Kate Kelland,"With many people travelling within the country for upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations on January 31, the United Nations health agency also said people should be aware of the risk that flu viruses might spread more widely. Among the new H7N9 cases, reported from several different provinces of China, was a 38-year-old man who died on January 9 and a five year-old girl from Guangdong province who became ill on January 14 and is now stable in hospital. Many of the other new patients were either in a serious or critical condition in hospitals. Several had reported recent exposure to poultry or poultry markets, but the WHO said the source of infections was still under investigation. “Given the population movement prior to Chinese New Year and potentially unpredictable behavior of influenza viruses, continued vigilance and close monitoring are needed,” the WHO’s China office said in a statement on its website. It advised people “to continue to practice good hygiene and handle food properly” but did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions. The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 199 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing 52 of them, according to an update on Monday from the WHO’s spokesman Gregory Hartl. Several clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China, but WHO reiterated on Monday that “so far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission”. Hartl told Reuters last week that the United Nations health agency had noted the recent rapid increase in human H7N9 infections and was keeping a watchful eye. “So far we haven’t seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,” he said. The WHO’s assessment is that “the current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.”  Experts say the Northern Hemisphere’s winter flu season is probably largely to blame for a significant increase in the number of cases of human H7N9 infection in recent weeks after they dwindled to almost nothing in July and August of 2013. “This trend is expected to continue through the winter months,” said the WHO’s China office. Experts have warned public health authorities and doctors to be on alert for any signals that the more widely circulating virus might be adapting or mutating to become easily transmissible between people."," ",true,Health News
10250,Raw Milk Straight from the Cow,"May 12, 2008","This story was about a concerning trend in consumer use of unpasteurized milk. As with other potentially functional foods, there are health claims made about the product which have no supporting evidence. The real issue which should have been reported on is the potential for harm associated with consumption of raw milk. The story does not do this justice, and would have been substantially strengthened by a deeper discussion (with experts) about the health risks of unpasteurized milk."," ","Although the story did not contain specific price details, it did mention that the farmers can sell raw-milk and raw-milk products at a ‘thick premium’ from which the reader could gather that the costs would be more than milk which has been pasteurized. The story mentioned a number of health claims so-called ‘fans’ of raw milk postulate can be derived through the use of raw milk. (The story also included comments from the FDA in which these claims were refuted.) It should have included some critical examination of the health claims made. The story mentioned safety concerns associated with consumption of raw milk, especially by individuals who may have heightened vulnerability. (The story also included comments from people who are fans of raw milk who claim these concerns are overblown.) However, this is one area where this story could have been improved. Raw milk has the potential to make people quite ill, especially children (which was mentioned in the story) but also pregnant women, those whose immunity is compromised as well as the general public. It should have included more information about infection rates among people consuming raw milk. The story contained the arguments raised by those opposed to and in favor of increasing availability of raw milk. It included a link to a site that refutes the information put forth by the FDA and mentions some of the epidemiology evidence linking raw milk with increased disease risk. The story really only provided  anecdotal evidence from one woman who stated that she had more health problems the previous year when she did not drink raw milk. It should have included some framework for understanding the fallacy of using this type of information as the basis for health decision making. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story has quotes from ‘fans’ of raw milk, a scientist with expertise in food safety, and material from the FDA. Beyond mention of raw milk and pasteurized milk, the story mentioned that two states (Washington and Maine) which permit raw milk to be sold but hold it to the same standard for bacteria counts as pasteurized milk. While the story did not list the states by name, it did mention that six states allow the sale of raw milk in stores and that 28 states allow the sale of raw milk on the farms where it is produced. The story mentioned that the FDA requirements about the sale and distribution of raw milk date back to 1987. Given multiple sources, there is no evidence the story relied solely or largely on a news release."," ",true," "

Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England, told the Mines and Money conference in London on Tuesday he and other investors, representing large pension funds, would extend their campaign. “We’re really concerned incumbency is preventing the speed up towards a supportive regulatory environment,” Matthews said. He said investors planned to draw up more resolutions and would focus on the chemical and transport industries, as well as the natural resources sector, in cases where companies that accept U.N. goals on climate change are “misaligned” with industry bodies to which they subscribe. Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment, which is campaigning alongside the Church of England, said in an emailed statement that negative corporate lobbying was a major reason for the slow progress towards action to limit temperature rises. “It’s completely unreasonable that companies use shareholder money to fund groups that do not act in investors’ long term interests,” she said. The ethical investors approve of some industry groups and are working with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which includes the world’s biggest miners, to deliver a global standard on dams that store mining waste, known as tailings. The ICMM has admitted mining has work to do to earn the trust of investors and says its members will begin implementing revised sustainability principles, which include measures to protect the climate and environment, next year."," ",mixture," "
42198,“Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation.”,"April 27, 2018",Q: Did Democrats in Maine legalize female genital mutilation? A: No. That practice is illegal across the U.S.,Saranac Hale Spencer,"Q: Did Democrats in Maine legalize female genital mutilation? A: No. That practice is illegal across the U.S. Female genital mutilation has been outlawed across the country since 1996. It is not legal in any U.S. state.But, an incendiary headline has been circulating on Facebook claiming: “Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation.”Facebook users flagged it as potentially false. It is.The underlying story is based on a recent vote in the Maine legislature, which was considering a bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law in addition to the existing federal law.The Senate and the House of Representatives in Maine failed to agree on the text of the bill, and the measure died at the end of the session on April 18. The failure of the bill, however, doesn’t mean that Maine will now “allow female genital mutilation,” as the headline claimed.Debate over the bill had been highly charged for months. The Southern Poverty Law Center published emails in February between one Republican representative and a group called ACT for America, which the SPLC has designated as hate group.ACT for America has “helped pass” female genital mutilation legislation in nine states, according to the group’s website. It has also “helped pass” legislation that bans Sharia Law and legislation that “protect those who ‘see something’ and ‘say something,'” according to its website.The American Civil Liberties Union also had weighed in on an early version of the bill in Maine, saying in a statement, “This bill is nothing more than an attempt to single out behavior that is commonly attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities as different from other forms of abuse.” The ACLU called the bill “redundant,” because “there are already severe penalties under both Maine and federal law that cover FGM.”According to a women’s advocacy group called Equality Now, there were 26 states as of September 2017 that had enacted legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation in addition to the federal ban. Those laws differ in a number of ways, including the age-range they cover and the allowance for culture as defense.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.18 U.S. Code Section 116 — Female genital mutilation.

8120,"Trump: Asian-Americans not responsible for virus, need protection.","March 23, 2020","U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been accused of racism in labeling the coronavirus pandemic the “Chinese virus,” said on Monday that Asian-Americans were not responsible for spreading the disease and needed to be protected."," ","Earlier on Monday, the New York Times cited advocacy groups and researchers as saying there had been a surge of verbal and physical assaults on Asian-Americans reported in newspapers and to tip lines as the virus has taken hold in the United States. Trump last week ratcheted up his rhetoric against China over the coronavirus, saying Beijing should have acted faster to warn the world after the disease outbreak there. He also dismissed criticism that his labeling it the “Chinese virus” was racist. He brushed aside a reporter’s question on Wednesday as to whether it was potentially harmful to Asian-Americans to give the disease that name, as well for an unnamed White House official to have privately termed it the “kung flu.”    On Monday, Trump tweeted: “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. “They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus.... is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!”  Trump repeated his remarks at a news conference with his coronavirus task force. Asked what prompted them, he replied:   “It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian-Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all ... so I just wanted to make that point, because they’re blaming China, and they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage, and I’m not gonna let that happen.”  Trump has repeatedly criticized China and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, but he has been careful to avoid criticisms of its president, Xi Jinping. On Friday, Trump said he greatly respected China and Xi, but added it was unfortunate the coronavirus began in China and got out of control. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing’s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks for people worldwide. At the same time, Trump and his administration have angrily rejected attempts by some Chinese officials to blame the virus on the U.S. military. The dispute is just the latest irritant in relations between the world two largest economies already strained by issues ranging from trade to press freedom. Speaking to AXIOS and HBO over the weekend, China’s ambassador to Washington appeared to distance himself from a foreign ministry spokesman who blamed the U.S. military for the virus, saying its origin was for scientists to determine, not diplomats. Cui Tiankai said the United States and China needed to work together to combat the virus and he hoped people would follow World Health Organization rules and avoid creating a stigma by linking the virus to a particular location."," ",true,Health News
9309,Nerve Zap Might Ease Pain of Herniated Disk,"November 30, 2018","This story describes research results presented at a radiology meeting that compared treating patients with lower back pain from disk herniation with either a pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) probe or multiple steroid injections. We also reviewed a news release about this research. Among the story’s strengths: It alerts readers that the study — presented as an abstract — has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end. However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence. It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose. Back pain is a common problem. Often it goes away with time and exercise. But chronic pain that does not respond to conservative treatment and includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica) is a leading cause of disability and an economic burden. More treatment options are needed, but identifying the true source of pain is part of the battle.","Michael Joyce, MD,Paul E. Levin, MD,Mary Chris Jaklevic","The story says pRF is “far cheaper” than steroid injections, but there’s no data on its cost. We found one web site, MD Save, offering procedures for $2,500, but it’s unclear whether that’s representative. The story could have helped readers by comparing the cost of CT-guided pRF, CT-guided steroid injections, and lumbar disk surgery. The story calls this treatment a potential “boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed,” and includes a glowing personal endorsement by the study’s lead author. Only near the end do we get a small amount of data: “By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ‘perceived’ recovery was reported by 95% of the pRF patients, compared with just 61% of the steroid injection patients.” The story doesn’t tell readers what “perceived” recovery means and how it was measured. The story doesn’t discuss the harms of this treatment. It’s full of language — “a simple zap to the spine,” “scalpel-free,” “noninvasive,” “less risky” — that might mislead readers into being falsely assured. A procedure that introduces instruments close to the spine and makes contact with major nerve roots carries risks of infection and nerve damage. Those should have been mentioned. The story does say that “diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient’s pain.” However, we think the story should have underscored the point that low back pain is often treated unnecessarily. Even if a herniated disk shows up in imaging — which is common — it might not be the cause of a patient’s pain. That opens the possibility that some patients will undergo a procedure that won’t help them, but could do harm. This is a close call. The story deserves credit for pointing out that the research presented at a medical meeting “is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.” We also like that it quoted a doctor who cautioned that it “remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition,” since back pain often resolves on it own. Still, there are other points we wish the story had addressed: Back pain is common, and this story does not disease monger. It gives a concise description of what disk herniation of the lower back is. Laudably, the story contains cautionary comments from a physician who was not involved with the study. He points out that most people with back pain “improve with time and exercise alone,” and “it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.” We wish some of the cautions had been placed higher in the story. The story did not mention conflicts of interest, and we could not find any that the authors have disclosed. The story mentions interventions that are commonly recommended for low back pain, including waiting it out. Generally speaking, there’s no standard treatment for most back pain, and often no treatment is recommended. This story mentions this treatment has been FDA-approved, but doesn’t explain whether it’s widely available, particularly for treating spinal disk herniation with spinal nerve compression. The story explains early on that pRT is “not new” although it’s claimed that recent technology advances enable doctors to deploy it with better accuracy. The story doesn’t rely on a news release.","https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-864323518.jpg,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/news-release-review/claims-about-pulsed-radiofrequency-for-back-pain-and-sciatica-are-premature/,https://press.rsna.org/pressrelease/2018_resources/2045/abstract.pdf",mixture,"back pain,pulsed radiofrequency,Radiological Society of North America"
4185,Kansas officials suggest alternatives to deal with pond scum.,,Kansas health and environment officials are recommending alternative ways for municipal water operators to treat toxic blue-green algal blooms that have troubled state lakes for nearly 10 years.," ","People and animals that come into contact with cyanobacteria algae might suffer diarrhea, headaches and other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Blooms have even killed small animals that drink the contaminated water. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has detected traces of toxins related to the blooms in at least five water treatment plants. The department has suggested adding activated carbon to the water treatment process, the Kansas News Service reported. The carbon causes algae to fall to the bottom of ponds, allowing clean water to pass through. But smaller water plant officials noted that adding carbon can also be more costly. “Any time there’s an algae bloom out at the lake there’s potential for that to get into the plant and through town,” said Jamie Amlong, the water plant supervisor of Norton County. “We’re on pins and needles from the beginning of the bloom until two or three weeks after the bloom.” Amlong noted the algae have bloomed on the county’s Keith Sebelius Lake since 2014, but didn’t really affect the city of Norton’s water until drifting into the plant’s intake pipes last year. Amlong added the entire plant was then forced to close as they drained and cleaned most of the tanks in an effort to safeguard the drinking water supply. The department offers a program to subsidize water quality tests searching for toxins caused by cyanobacteria, officials said. Twenty-three of the 72 water systems that get their water from the state’s rivers and lakes signed up for the program. Robert Gavin, professional geologist of the department’s Public Water Supply section, said the program allows local water systems to avert polluted water instead of trying to reverse a problem. Previously, state park officials would detect a bloom on a lake before alerting Kansas’ public water division, which would hasten to get tests out to those sites. But bottles for raw water samples are now sent out weekly via the mail. If there’s ever a positive test result, additional bottles are sent to inspect the treated water. “After a couple of years, this will probably be old hat. They’ll kind of just know what to do,” Gavin said. “But they’re all kind of learning right now.” ___ Information from: KMUW-FM.","https://www.cdc.gov/habs/pdf/cyanobacteria_faq.pdf,https://www.kcur.org/post/how-pond-scum-ruining-more-your-kansas-lake-trip",true,"Plants, Algal blooms, Kansas, Lakes, Algae, Environment, General News, Water treatment"
23475,"McDonald's in England only sells organic milk and free-range eggs, which provides more nutritious offerings than in the U.S.","August 31, 2010",Chef Jamie Oliver praises McDonald's in England,Robert Farley,"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a well-known crusader for healthier eating. So it may have come as a surprise to hear him give a shout-out on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 29, 2010, to the fast-food giant McDonald's -- or at least the restaurants in his homeland, England. Oliver, AKA the Naked Chef, is perhaps best known to American audiences for his Emmy-winning reality program Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution on ABC, in which he tried to transform the eating habits of the residents of Huntington, W.Va., statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country. On ABC's This Week, Oliver said the food revolution is about giving people the tools to make good, nutritious choices. But host Christiane Amanpour asked Oliver to respond to a comment David Letterman made to him when he appeared on the Late Show: ""Try as hard as you might, you're never going to succeed, because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food which is inherently unhealthy,"" Letterman said. Said Oliver: ""In the one way, he's right. You know, the structure of commerce and food in America is so intertwined in broadcast, print media, advertising, TV. I think that the problem we have to have -- and it's an interesting one. I'll throw it back at you. Like fast food I've hated for many years. And the last two years, I like stopped. And I actually now start to see (fast food chains) ironically as part of the solution. ""Now, I'll give you -- I'll give you one brand, like McDonald's. McDonald's, in England, has had its best three years ever, profitability. It only sells organic milk, free range eggs. You know, it's got an incredible standard of beef. And their ethics is really ... moving. But that's nothing like the one in the States. And the only distinguishing part is the public and what they expect."" Part of the allure of McDonald's is its uniformity, that a Big Mac in New York will be the same as one in London. And so we wondered if Oliver was right that McDonald's restaurants in England really ""only sell organic milk"" and ""free range eggs,"" and that, by implication, they are dramatically different and more healthy than McDonald's restaurants in the United States. We made queries with McDonald's officials in the U.S. and Britain, and neither responded, but we were able to piece together the pertinent facts from company web pages and documents. Let's break this into two parts. First, do McDonald's restaurants in England ""only sell"" organic milk? According to the McDonald's UK website, all of the bottled milk offered for sale in UK McDonald's (most of it sold along with kids' meals) is ""semi-skimmed organic."" In 2007, McDonald's UK made an even bigger commitment to organic milk, announcing that all the milk served with the teas and coffees it sells in 1,200 outlets in the UK will come from organic British cows. The company said organic farmers who supply McDonald's ""don't use (genetically modified) feed or artificial pesticides in fields where their cows graze."" Media reports suggested McDonald's alone could account for 5 percent of the UK’s organic milk supplies. Organic milk is not, however, used in milkshakes in the British stores. According to the website, ""Organic milk is still a relatively small industry in the UK and McDonald's simply can't find a supplier that can meet the high volume demands. The company is in talks with the dairy industry about how it can facilitate more farmers switching to organic but, until the organic food supply chain can guarantee that it can supply the required amount, McFlurries, Sundaes and Milkshakes will continue to be made from non-organic milk from the British Isles."" (In the U.S., McDonald's does not use organic milk.) Second, do McDonald's restaurants in England only use free-range eggs (meaning, eggs that come from hens that are not in cages and are free to roam outside)? McDonald's does, and the move generated quite a bit of positive press for McDonald's, including a ""Good Egg"" award from Compassion in World Farming in recognition of McDonald's Europe committing to using 100 percent free-range, cage-free eggs in all locations in the European Union by the end of this year. ""We’re thrilled to be awarding such a well-known company for moving to cage-free eggs across the whole of Europe,"" said Dr. Lesley Lambert, Director of Research & Food Policy at Compassion in World Farming, in a press release for the award. ""McDonald’s decision will benefit huge numbers of farm birds. By choosing to do the right thing on eggs across Europe, McDonald’s has shown great leadership on an issue which many consumers feel strongly about."" McDonald's in the United States, however, has not embraced a similar switch. In April, the Humane Society of the United States (which owns stock in McDonald's USA) proposed to shareholders that the company switch 5 percent of the eggs it purchases for its U.S. locations to ""cage-free"" eggs by January 2011. The Board of Directors recommended against the switch, saying it would not be in the best interest of shareholders. ""As we have examined this issue over the years, we have determined that there is no agreement in the global scientific community about how to balance the advantages and disadvantages of laying hen housing systems,"" the board wrote in a proxy statement. ""Cage-free systems, for instance, allow birds to exhibit more natural behaviors, but may pose more risk with regard to the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant gap in scientific knowledge related to a wide range of sustainability impacts of laying hen housing—environmental impact, food safety, worker safety, animal health and well-being, and food affordability."" According to a New York Times story about the proposal in May 2009, ""McDonald’s USA announced its participation in a coalition with leading animal welfare scientists, academics, non-governmental organizations, such as the American Humane Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association, food manufacturers, egg suppliers and other retail companies to study housing alternatives for egg-laying hens in the U.S. The study will look at the sustainability impacts of different laying hen housing options, including cage-free aviary housing, enriched housing (which includes nests and perches) and conventional caged housing systems (currently used by the vast majority of the contemporary U.S. food supply system)."" Paul Shapiro, senior director of the Humane Society’s factory farming campaign, said McDonald's has been ""looking into"" the issue for years. ""There is a dramatic difference between the two companies (McDonald's in the U.S. versus the U.K.) with regard to animal welfare,"" Shapiro said. In April, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Lisa McComb, told the New York Times the disparity was due to the high consumer demand for cage-free eggs in Europe and a more robust cage-free egg production infrastructure there. Oliver doesn't explicitly argue the U.K. McDonald's restaurants offer more nutritious food, but given Amanpour's question -- and the topic of the segment -- we think many people would be left with that impression. So is it true that the organic milk and free-range eggs mean healthier food than in the U.S.? ""No, that would not reliably mean better nutrition,"" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine. ""It appeals to the popular sentiment, without changing much about the food."" One can make a case that using ""cage-free"" hens is more humane to the animals, Katz said, but that doesn't directly correlate to better nutrition for consumers (though it may reduce the risk of bacterial infection). As for using organic skim milk, Katz said there is definitely value, health-wise, to using fat-free milk. But the nutritional value of organic milk versus non-organic is unproven, he said. ""I am a proponent of organic dairy,"" Katz said. ""But there is no definitive evidence that organic means better health value in people. I think there's probably a potentially small movement in nutritional value. But there is a much larger movement in public perception."" Katz said McDonald's could take much more meaningful steps to improve the nutritional value of its food, for example, by changing to whole wheat bread in buns or making the burgers lower in saturated fat. But just switching to organic milk and using free-range eggs doesn't much alter the nutritional value of McDonald's meals, he said. As for Oliver's comment, he's correct that McDonald's in England uses organic milk. Organic milk is served with coffee and tea, and for bottled milk. But Oliver was off a bit when he said it ""only uses"" organic milk. The British McDonald's stores still use non-organic milk in milkshakes. Oliver was on the mark when he noted that in the U.K., McDonald's uses only free-range eggs, while they are not used in the U.S. But when Oliver said McDonald's in England is ""nothing like"" the U.S. one, he implies the policies in England translate to substantially more nutritional food offerings. While the U.K. policies have drawn praise from animal rights groups, experts say it's a stretch to say they translate to better nutrition. And so we rule Oliver's claim .","https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/mcdonalds-parries-on-cage-free-eggs/, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555894/McDonalds-goes-McOrganic.html, http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/food/drinks-and-shakes/organic-milk.mcdj, http://thomson.mobular.net/thomson/7/3083/4205/document_0/MCD_Proxy2010.pdf, http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/04/mcdonalds-rejects-5-percent-cage-free-eggs-proposal-usa.php, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1268752/Jamie-Oliver-pays-tribute-old-enemy-McDonalds.html, http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/consumer_goods/article5870369.ece, http://www.mcdpressoffice.eu/downloads/pr/Good%20Egg_press_release.pdf, http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/food/2010/04/29/2010-04-29_naked_chef_jamie_oliver_british_mcdonalds_is_healthier_than_the_american_version.html, https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-crisis-classroom/story?id=11506701&page=3",mixture,"National, Education, Food Safety, This Week - ABC News, Jamie Oliver, "

Amy Beth Hanson	He was joined at the signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The bill continues the program, which began in 2016, and provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. It would have ended on June 30 if lawmakers had not reached an agreement. He also held ceremonial signings for other bills to lower health insurance and prescription drug costs. “These bills continue the progress our state has made in recent years to provide quality and affordable health care to Montanans, and they will further our efforts to increase access, reduce costs, and improve the quality of care,” Bullock said. “By finding common ground and taking much-needed action now, we continue to be an example for other states to follow.” Bullock, however, vetoed a bill that sought to help insurance companies negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers — the middle man between drug manufacturers and pharmacies. The vetoed bill would have required any rebates offered by drug manufacturers go directly to the health insurers to be used to reduce premiums for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The office of state Auditor and Insurance Commissioner Matt Rosendale wrote the bill, saying it would have saved about 70,000 Montanans up to $8 million in the first year. The bill would increase administrative costs and result in higher drug costs, Bullock wrote in his veto letter. “Bullock’s veto is a gift to the pharmaceutical and insurance industries and a slap in the face to consumers,” Rosendale said in a statement. Bullock has signed several bills dealing with pharmacy benefit managers, including bills that would not allow PBM’s to charge pharmacies unexpected fees or prevent pharmacies from operating mail order businesses. Another bill mirrors a federal law that says PBM’s can’t prevent pharmacies from telling patients the cash price of their drug is less than their insurance co-payment. The governor earlier signed a bill, similar to one initially proposed by Rosendale’s office in 2017, to set up a high-cost reinsurance program for policies sold on the exchange. It will use premium taxes and federal money that would have been used for premium tax credits to pay medical claims that cost more than $40,000 and less than $1 million. It’s estimated the reinsurance pool will offset any insurance premium increases by 10% to 20%. Buttrey’s Medicaid expansion bill requires able-bodied recipients to participate in 80 hours of work or community engagement per month, strengthens an asset test, allows the health department to verify an applicant’s income with the Department of Revenue and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. It also adds a tax on hospitals to leverage more federal money and increase reimbursement rates for Medicaid claims. It also includes $2.5 million to help recipients with job training. It’s estimated the Medicaid expansion program could bring about $720 million in federal funding into the state in each of the next two fiscal years. Supporters said the program created jobs, saved lives, helped keep rural hospitals open and reduced uncompensated care for hospitals, which reduces cost-shifting to insured residents. Bullock also signed bills Thursday to: — Allow Montana reservations to adopt the Community Health Aide Program, which allows dental health aides, behavioral health aides, and community health aides to work with licensed providers to increase access to health care on reservations; — Create a grant program to support local mobile crisis mental health teams that could help ease the use of law enforcement and hospital staff in the case of a mental health crisis; — Appropriate $500,000 for suicide prevention for veterans and Native American youth.	 	true	Health, Prescription drug costs, Montana, Medicaid, Bills, Steve Bullock
38791	 A study found that some hotdog brands contained human DNA. 	October 27, 2015	Human DNA Found in Hotdogs	  Rich Buhler & Staff  	Human DNA was found in about 2% of hot dogs that were analyzed in one study, but that doesn’t mean people who eat them are cannibals. Clear Labs, a nonprofit group that analyzes food at the molecular level, undertook a “Hot Dog Study” that looked at 345 hotdog and sausage samples marketed under 75 different brands and sold at 10 different retailers: Each sample we analyze is assigned a Clear Score. The Clear Score is a representation of how closely a product’s label claims match its actual molecular contents. The higher the score, the more closely a product abides by its claims. To create the score, each item is molecularly analyzed through our proprietary DNA sequencing workflow. We screen for major, medium, and minor substitution, and we deduct points accordingly. We then examine products for nutrition-content accuracy, such as carbs, fat, calories, and protein. The Hot Dog study found human DNA samples in 2% of the 345 hotdogs and sausages that it looked at. Two-thirds of that human DNA was found in vegetarian hot dogs, according to the study. Overall, 14.4% of the hotdogs and sausages that were tested were listed as “problematic” because of substituted or unexpected ingredients or hygienic issues. Human DNA found in hotdogs was classified as a hygienic issue because human hair or skin dander likely got into the product during the manufacturing process. So, it’s true that human DNA was found in hotdog samples — but that doesn’t mean that people who eat hot dogs are cannibals. The FDA allows many “defects” in processed foods that most people would find even more disgusting than human DNA. Things like maggots, rodent hair, feces, cigarette butts and mold are allowed in processed foods at allowable levels because, the FDA reports: The FDA set these action levels because it is economically impractical to grow, harvest, or process raw products that are totally free of non-hazardous, naturally occurring, unavoidable defects. Products harmful to consumers are subject to regulatory action whether or not they exceed the action levels. Because hot dogs don’t appear on the FDA’s list of product defects, the agency would likely decide what action needs to be taken on a “case-by-case basis” if it confirmed the report’s findings.

11844	Donald Trump Says Joe Scarborough is party to an """"unsolved mystery"""" from his time as a congressman in Florida.""","November 29, 2017","Trump said Scarborough is party to an ""unsolved mystery"" from his time as a congressman in Florida. The guts of the attack are nothing more than an unproven conspiracy theory -- no different than President Barack Obama being born outside the United States or Ted Cruz’s father being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This case is not unsolved. It is not a mystery.",Aaron Sharockman,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the firing of NBC’s Matt Lauer over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while encouraging the network to look deeper into its employees. ""Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 29, 2017. He then followed up: ""So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!"" Trump mentioned three NBC officials -- Lack, the chairman of NBC News, Griffin, the president of MSNBC, and Scarborough, a former Florida congressman who hosts Morning Joe on MSNBC. In this fact-check, we are focusing on Trump’s attack of Scarborough’s ""unsolved mystery."" Trump is referring to an incident in 2001, when a 28-year-old congressional aide to Scarborough was found dead in one of Scarborough’s district offices. Scarborough represented Florida Panhandle counties as a Republican from 1995 to 2001. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair, then the Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times, covered the death. His report is only 286 words long, so we are republishing it in full. A congressional aide in Fort Walton Beach told people she was feeling ill the day before she was found dead, according to a police report. The Fort Walton Beach Police Department report says Lori Klausutis, an aide to Rep. Joe Scarborough, told a co-worker on July 19 that she was not feeling well, but did not elaborate. She made a similar comment to a mail carrier. She was found dead in Scarborough's district office the next morning by two people who came to seek help with an immigration case. Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk. The head injury caused the death, Berkland said. The report, which was released Monday, quotes friends and relatives as saying Klausutis was happily married and was known as ""Little Miss Mary Sunshine."" They said she was under moderate stress in the days before she died. She had two assignments due for college courses. She and her husband had recently moved into a new house, and she was looking for a new job because Scarborough recently resigned from Congress, effective in September. Relatives told police she was upbeat about a job possibility at a local radio station and had recently received a $6,000 raise. Relatives said she had been taking medication for acne and that she suffered a head injury in a traffic accident when she was a teenager that left her in a coma. When she recovered, she had signs of short-term memory loss. A mail carrier who came in the office on July 19 said she appeared nervous. He said Klausutis told him she did not feel well. The story has dogged Scarborough among conspiracy-minded individuals. Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal website Daily Kos, was banned from MSNBC for suggesting Scarborough may have played some role in Klausutis’ death. The guts of the conspiracy theory center around Scarborough’s announcement in May 2001, two months before Klausutis’ death, that he would resign from Congress on Sept. 6, 2001, to spend more time with his two sons. Scarborough was divorced but had joint custody of his two sons. ""It's impossible to be a good father and a good congressman,"" Scarborough said in an interview the St, Petersburg Times, which is now the Tampa Bay Times. ""You are home 180 nights out of the year and you're in D.C. 180 nights. No matter where you are, the kids are going to be without you half the year."" There’s little more to the conspiracy, but the clarity of the medical examiner’s report did not satisfy people who believe the conspiracy. That list apparently includes Trump. Scarborough responded to the president on Twitter, saying: ""Looks like I picked a good day to stop responding to Trump's bizarre tweets. He is not well."" Trump has been engaged in a running feud with Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski. Trump said Scarborough is party to an ""unsolved mystery"" from his time as a congressman in Florida. The guts of the attack are nothing more than an unproven conspiracy theory -- no different than President Barack Obama being born outside the United States or Ted Cruz’s father being involved in the assassination of President John F.

15716,Wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the (NSA) database.,"April 9, 2015","Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context.",Katie Sanders,"Most Americans have a fuzzy understanding of exactly what the National Security Agency can and cannot see with its surveillance programs, much less what a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden tried to do about it. That’s the finding, anyway, of informal street interviews by John Oliver’s crew at Last Week Tonight on HBO. Oliver devoted his April 5 show to the NSA spying story. It included an exclusive interview with Snowden, who is living in Russia after the State Department canceled his passport. And it included the topic of this fact-check: Can emails sent between two people living in the United States unwittingly end up on the computer screen of some NSA analyst? Oliver, who blends comedy with journalism, framed the discussion around the NSA peeping on nude pictures. Oliver asked Snowden to describe the capability of various NSA surveillance programs in relation to nude pictures sent by Americans, starting with ""702 surveillance."" This refers to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This section was added in 2008 and was renewed under President Barack Obama in 2012. Could the NSA see a picture of, say, Oliver’s privates under this provision, he asked? ""Yes,"" Snowden said, ""the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which section 702 falls under, allows the bulk collection of internet communications that are one-end foreign."" After an Oliver joke about ""bulk collection,"" Snowden continued, ""So if you have your email somewhere like Gmail, hosted on a server overseas or transferred overseas or anytime crosses outside the borders of the United States, your junk ends up in the database."" Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage. ""No,"" Snowden said. ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" Is it really true that this situation (regardless of the content of the email) could happen, and if so, is it likely? You’ve got mail … being collected by the NSA Several experts in national security law agreed Snowden’s scenario is plausible, thanks to holes in international surveillance laws that affect data shared between Americans living in America. The law that Oliver mentioned, Section 702 of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, is labeled ""Procedures For Targeting Certain Persons Outside The United States Other Than United States Persons."" Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. Not necessarily. The section addresses spying on communications on U.S. soil in which one end of the conversation is foreign. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Technology and Democracy, and American Civil Liberties Union, deem it a ""backdoor search loophole"" that allows the NSA to get access to information on U.S. citizens. The section says the government cannot ""intentionally target"" citizens of the United States with its surveillance, nor can it target a person outside the country to learn more about the communications of a person who is in the United States. ""Intentionally,"" obviously, is a pretty big gap. NSA communications spying under Section 702 does not need an individual warrant. There are a few government spying programs that we know about, through Snowden’s leaks to journalists, that operate using Section 702, including Prism and Upstream. Prism, as outlined in a leaked slide, allows the NSA to collect via court order email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files of foreign targets from technology companies such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Analysts reportedly use Prism in concert with Upstream, by which the NSA collects foreigners’ communications directly from the fiber-optic backbone of the Internet. A leaked NSA slide reported by the Washington Post describes Upstream as amassing ""communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."" Through those spying programs, it is possible that American-to-American email could hit an overseas server and be pulled into NSA databases even though those emails are not the target of NSA searches. The law does not prohibit this kind of ""incidental"" collection of Americans’ communications, as long as it was part of an otherwise valid collection of non-Americans’ information, said Stephen Vladeck, American University national security law professor. Government reports, leaks and a scathing 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion offer more proof that the NSA cannot separate out communications between Americans from the emails involving a foreigner. ""NSA’s knowing acquisition of tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications through its Upstream collection is a cause of concern for the court,"" wrote FISC Judge John D. Bates in the declassified opinion. It’s unknown exactly how often this happens, but it does not appear unusual. ""It doesn’t matter whether it’s a d--- pic or a bland email,"" said Andrew Crocker, a senior analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sued the NSA to release the Bates opinion. ""These are all things that can be swept up."" By law, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" wholly domestic communications it obtains, said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who represented the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court while working for the Justice Department. This could mean deleting the email or not searching or using the information, something Snowden doesn’t say. ""I can’t promise the email wouldn’t end up in an NSA database,"" she said, ""but it’s not going to be accessible to the government if it does."" Other experts pointed out that we don’t know for sure what happens to these exchanges when they are collected. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society, said many important features of Upstream collection ""haven’t leaked and remain classified,"" such as whether it involves bulk collection, massive-but-targeted collection or only individually targeted collection, he said. Email routes that cross international boundaries So, yes, it’s possible that an email between you and your wife or husband about the grocery list could wind up in the hands of the NSA. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. How likely is that to happen? Understanding how or why an email may hit an overseas server even if it’s sent to someone in the same area requires a basic knowledge of how the Internet works. But even then, it’s complicated. So we turned to technologists, who had different opinions. Predicting how an email travels to its destination once you hit ""send"" is not an exact science — and it can change from hour to hour. When a person sends an email, it goes through the Internet service provider to an email provider, is exchanged with another provider, and goes back to someone else’s Internet service provider. If the Internet provider is big, like Verizon, the most efficient, least congested path to route the bits of information might just be a cable that crosses a foreign country’s boundary. Chats, pictures and messages travel from senders to recipients through the Internet along fiber-optic cables, some underground and some undersea. These cables can send messages in milliseconds. ""The way the network thinks about distance is very different from the way you think about distance in the real physical world,"" said Joseph Hall, Center for Democracy and Technology chief technologist. Hall mentioned an example using the concept of ""trombone routing:"" Two people could be on opposite sides of Denver, and the most efficient way to get bits of information to them may be through a cable that runs through Canada. Mayer, of Stanford University, suggested the odds are good that your message is stored domestically if you’re an American who is working within the continental United States and who is using Gmail. Mayer called Snowden’s example of an intimate picture shared between a couple in New York hitting a London server en route to its destination ""hypothetically possible, but it’s unlikely."" The route between providers would have to be unusual, and the connection would have to be unencrypted, he said. ""There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear,"" Mayer said. ""I just don’t think this is a very generalizable example."" On the other hand, Hall said, ""It’s not hard to see this happening at all,"" even though more providers are encrypting their networks in response to NSA practices. Even though Hall and Mayer have different estimations for how likely it is for a U.S. user’s communications to be transmitted over a national border at a given time, Hall agrees it’s more likely for an email to cross a border in places that don’t have a huge infrastructure. Because Snowden mentioned Google’s Gmail service as an example, we checked in with the company to figure out under which conditions this example could happen. The company has strengthened the encryption of its infrastructure as a way to dissuade the government from using ""backdoor"" methods of tapping its network data without its knowledge. Emails between Gmail accounts are encrypted as they go to Gmail servers, which essentially means they look like gibberish to outsiders, and as they move from Google’s data centers around the country and the world. Copies of emails could be stored in several places, including in data centers abroad, as a way to provide backups in case one center fails. If the NSA tried to collect emails between Google data centers, they may be able to pull the metadata of messages (the to and from) but not the content. If one side of the exchange is not a Gmail user, the message may not be encrypted and therefore may be more vulnerable. As for how often an email may end up in a foreign server, even if it’s between two American Gmail users, spokesman Aaron Stein said, ""We aren't always able to predict how often that happens."" The NSA press office did not return requests for comment. Our ruling Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information.

11585,New Findings Show Xience Stents Are as Safe and Effective as Others,"May 13, 2008","This story is an example of what’s often missing in medical research stories in a business section. The story is about a new cardiovascular stent that may be available if it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration. But the story does not provide much insight about the actual utility of implanting stents. The story quoted an investigator on the project as saying that there was a lower heart-attack rate in those patients receiving this new stent. However – the published study indicated that while there were fewer heart attacks, this difference was not statistically significant. Beyond this, it is a comparison of heart attack rates in individuals who received stents and does include any indication of how this rate compares to that seen in people receiving optimal medical therapy but who don’t get a stent. The story fails to deliver any independent perspective – only letting us hear from a company spokesman and one study investigator. Not everyone who reads medical research stories in a business section is interested primarily as a shareholder. Some people want more context, more on the quality of the evidence, more on the size of the potential benefits and harms, and more on what this thing is likely to cost them. This story – which reported more on the competition among or revenues for device manufacturers – didn’t help those readers. And when you think of it, why wouldn’t shareholders want that missing information as well?"," ","The story did not project any cost of this new stent; it did provide estimates for the amount of sales revenue generated by those drug-eluting stents that are currently available to consumers. (The story also did not provide information about how much these stents cost consumers either.) There was no discussion of associated costs for the medications that need to accompany the use of these drug eluting stents. The story did not adequately explain the intended appropriate use for this new stent. The story indicated that the new stent decreased the need for repeat treatment in the target vessel and that the new stent decreased the occurrence rate for heart attacks. There was no comparison of this stent with no stent at all. In addition – as the information provided either came from the oral presentation at a conference or from the company news release – and has not been peer reviewed – the story should have been explicit about the source of the limited information it did present. The story provided quantitative data indicating that the rate at which blood clot formation occurred after implanting the new stent was comparable to the rate with one of the currently available drug-eluting stents. However there was no information about how the harms with this new stent compared with bare metal stents or no stent at all. The story included some quantitative data from the research paper published in April 2008; it mentioned some of the research findings that were presented at a recent meeting. It did not include the specific data from this meeting which is appropriate given their preliminary nature. That said, the story is really about claims that this new drug-eluting stent is better than the currently available drug-eluting stents and since the data backing that claim has not yet been reviewed by objective experts in the field, the story should have stated this explicitly. The story engaged in subtle disease mongering because in its discussion of the use for this new product to treat ‘blocked blood vessels’ it failed to acknowlege that in fact, national guidelines don’t recommend the use of stents to treat all blocked coronary arteries, only those through which flow is occluded 70% or more. The story would have benefited greatly by including comment(s) from someone other than a company spokesperson or someone involved in the study. This could have provided readers with some insight about what this new product might add to the field. The story did not even provide a clear picture of what would be involved in treatment using the medical device highlighted, let alone outline the other options available for those with cardiovascular disease. It’s clear from the story that the stent in question is not yet approved by the FDA. The story was about one more drug-eluting stent that may come on the market but it was unclear about how this stent differs from those currently on the market. We can’t be sure if the story relied solely or largely on a news release, but the quantitative information about the benefit of this product appears to rely on the company news release. If not, the story should have explained where it came from. We do know the story only included comments from the company and from someone involved in the study – no independent perspectives."," ",false," "
8645,Italy looks to safeguard biomedical valley leading fight against COVID-19.,"April 3, 2020",Italy plans to tighten health checks to ensure that work is not disrupted in a small northern town specialising in the production of medical supplies to tackle its coronavirus crisis.,Stephen Jewkes,"The area snuggled around the medieval town of Mirandola has become a focus for desperate health authorities seeking to source equipment in the European country where COVID-19 has taken the most deadly toll. Already home to a cluster of companies making high-end products for dialysis, heart surgery and transfusions, it has found itself on the front line of efforts to treat patients during the pandemic. “This is a key strategic sector that we need to nurture and we’re going to make sure it stays open for business,” said Sergio Venturi, coronavirus czar for the northern region of Emilia Romagna where Mirandola is located. The idea is to ask companies to carry out swab tests on their employees to help monitor the health of workers in an area deemed of national strategic interest. Faster tests being developed in a nearby laboratory could also come into play once validated. “What we’re looking to do is ask for daily screening for all staff in the area so there’s no risk of the virus leading to a shutdown. We can’t afford that,” Venturi told Reuters. The measures underline the importance of the hub, created around 50 years ago by the pharmacist and entrepreneur Mario Veronesi. Mirandola, which has a population of only around 24,000,   plays host to about 100 high-tech medical companies including Germany’s Fresenius SE (FREG.DE), ventilator multinational Medtronic (MDT.N), and UK respiratory support group Intersurgical. Companies have been working flat out on coronavirus-related production such as filters and circuits to help supply oxygen, and disposable medical items to hook patients up to ventilators. Production in the area, badly damaged in a deadly earthquake eight years ago, has shot up by more than 20%. Dimar, one of a handful of companies producing respiratory helmets, had police and staff from Italy’s Civil Protection unit knocking on its doors to take stock back to neighbouring Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst affected regions. The company, which supplies emergency departments in around 125 hospitals, has ratcheted up output of its face-covering helmets that allow patients to be treated away from overwhelmed intensive care units. “We wanted to double production but it’s just not possible since that would require building plant and that takes more than six months,” Dimar founder Maurizio Borsari said, adding that problems faced by suppliers, transport bottlenecks and a shortage of raw materials was also holding up work. Borsari said police patrols in the district had risen sharply since the crisis started to protect businesses. A dearth of equipment such as surgical masks and ventilators has left hospitals and medical staff across the north struggling to cope, and concern is growing the spread of the virus to the poorer south could cause some health systems there to collapse. It was another Mirandola company, UK-based Intersurgical, that in 72 hours last month built a prototype circuit developed by an Italian medical team allowing two patients to use the same ventilator – effectively doubling capacity at a stroke.

35273,"Microsoft owns patent ""666,"" which involves inserting microchips into people to mine their activity for cryptocurrency purposes. ","April 20, 2020","What's true: Microsoft published a patent for a ""cryptocurrency system using body activity data."" This patent is filed under the number WO2020060606A1. What's false: The number WO2020060606A1 contains three ""6's"" but is obviously not the same as ""666."" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips.",Dan Evon,"The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated, how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes. This conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain. This patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers “666,” the biblical mark of the devil, and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the “World Order.”    The above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, “WO” does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil’s number. This patent is for a “cryptocurrency system” that “uses body activity data.” Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number “WO2020060606A1.”  The patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips. The diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the “person,” “user device,” and “sensor” are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the “user device” in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets: User device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6. The patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The “sensor” may also be its own standalone component: Sensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130. At no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person’s skin."," ",false,"Technology, COVID-19"
3083,House passes $1.4T government spending bill amid impeachment.,,"The Democratic-controlled House voted Tuesday to pass a $1.4 trillion government spending package, handing President Donald Trump a victory on his U.S.-Mexico border fence while giving Democrats spending increases across a swath of domestic programs."," Andrew Taylor","The hard-fought legislation also funds a record Pentagon budget and is serving as a must-pass legislative locomotive to tow an unusually large haul of unrelated provisions into law, including an expensive repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health plans, help for retired coal miners, and an increase from 18 to 21 in the nationwide legal age to buy tobacco products. The two-bill package, some 2,371 pages long after additional tax provisions were folded in on Tuesday morning, was unveiled Monday afternoon and adopted less than 24 hours later as lawmakers prepared to wrap up reams of unfinished work against a backdrop of Wednesday’s vote on impeaching Trump. The House first passed a measure funding domestic programs on a 297-120 vote. But one-third of the Democrats defected on a 280-138 vote on the second bill, which funds the military and the Department of Homeland Security, mostly because it funds Trump’s border wall project. The spending legislation would forestall a government shutdown this weekend and give Trump steady funding for his U.S.-Mexico border fence, a move that frustrated Hispanic Democrats and party liberals. The year-end package is anchored by a $1.4 trillion spending measure that caps a difficult, monthslong battle over spending priorities. The mammoth measure made public Monday takes a split-the-differences approach that’s a product of divided power in Washington, offering lawmakers of all stripes plenty to vote for — and against. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was a driving force, along with administration pragmatists such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who negotiated the summertime budget deal that it implements. The White House said Tuesday that Trump will sign the measure. ”The president is poised to sign it and to keep the government open,” said top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. The bill also offers business friendly provisions on export financing, flood insurance and immigrant workers. The roster of add-ons grew over the weekend to include the permanent repeal of a tax on high-cost “Cadillac” health insurance benefits and a hard-won provision to finance health care and pension benefits for about 100,000 retired union coal miners threatened by the insolvency of their pension fund. A tax on medical devices and health insurance plans would also be repealed permanently. The cost of the package grew as lawmakers added the repeal of three so-called “Obamacare” taxes and extended expiring tax breaks. Those policy changes will add $428 billion to the deficit over 10 years. The legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in Washington. Republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for Trump’s border wall. Democrats controlling the House succeeded in winning a 3.1% raise for federal civilian employees and the first installment of funding on gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition. Late Monday, negotiators unveiled a scaled-back $39 billion package of additional business tax breaks, renewing tax breaks for craft brewers and distillers, among others. The so-called tax extenders are a creature of Washington, a heavily lobbied menu of arcane tax breaks that are typically tailored to narrow, often parochial interests like renewable energy, capital depreciation rules and racehorse ownership. But a bigger effort to trade refundable tax credits for the working poor for fixes to the 2017 GOP tax bill didn’t pan out. The sweeping legislation, introduced as two packages for political and tactical purposes, is part of a major final burst of legislation that’s passing Congress this week despite bitter partisan divisions and Wednesday’s likely impeachment of Trump. Thursday promises a vote on a major rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while the Senate is about to send the president the annual defense policy bill for the 59th year in a row. The core of the spending bill is formed by the 12 annual agency appropriations bills passed by Congress each year. It fills in the details of a bipartisan framework from July that delivered about $100 billion in agency spending increases over the coming two years instead of automatic spending cuts that would have sharply slashed the Pentagon and domestic agencies. The increase in the tobacco purchasing age to 21 also applies to e-cigarettes and vaping devices and gained momentum after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signed on. But anti-smoking activists said the provision didn’t go far enough because it failed to ban flavored vaping products popular with teenagers. “The evidence is clear that flavored e-cigarettes are driving the youth epidemic,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “As long as flavored e-cigarettes remain available, kids will find ways to get them and this epidemic will continue.” Other add-ons include a variety of provisions sought by business and labor interests and their lobbyists in Washington. For business, there’s a seven-year extension of the charter of the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance transactions benefiting U.S. exporters, as well as a renewal of the government’s terrorism risk insurance program. The financially troubled government flood insurance program would be extended through September, as would several visa programs for both skilled and seasonal workers. Labor won repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on high-cost employer health plans, which was originally intended to curb rapidly growing health care spending. But it disproportionately affected high-end plans won under union contracts, and Democratic labor allies had previously succeeded in temporary repeals. Democrats controlling the House won increased funding for early childhood education and a variety of other domestic programs. They also won higher Medicaid funding for the cash-poor government of Puerto Rico, which is struggling to recover from hurricane devastation and a resulting economic downturn. While Republicans touted defense hikes and Democrats reeled off numerous increases for domestic programs, most of the provisions of the spending bill enjoy bipartisan support, including increases for medical research, combating the opioid epidemic, Head Start, and child care grants to states. Democrats also secured $425 million for states to upgrade their election systems, and they boosted the U.S. Census budget $1.4 billion above Trump’s request. They won smaller increases for the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy programs and affordable housing. “I am so proud that we are able to do so much good for children and families across the country and around the world,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. The outcome in the latest chapter in the long-standing battle over Trump’s border wall awards Trump with $1.4 billion for new barriers — equal to last year’s appropriation — while preserving Trump’s ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. That’s a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded Democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs and avert the threat of simply funding the government on autopilot. “Many members of the CHC will vote against it,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. “It’s true that there are a lot of good things and Democratic victories in the spending agreement. I think everybody appreciates those. What members of the Hispanic Caucus are concerned with is the wall money, the high level of detention beds, and most of all with the ability of the president to transfer money both to wall and to detention beds in the future.” The bill also extends a long-standing freeze on lawmakers’ pay despite behind-the-scenes efforts this spring to revive a cost-of-living hike approved years ago but shelved during the Obama administration. Because dozens of Democrats oppose the border wall, Pelosi paired money for the Department of Homeland Security with the almost $700 billion Pentagon budget, which won more than enough GOP votes to offset Democratic defections."," ",true,"Global trade, AP Top News, Government spending, Mexico, Health, General News, Legislation, Politics, Immigration, Impeachments, Business, Bills, Tobacco industry regulation, Donald Trump"
31207,Chumlee from 'Pawn Stars' has passed away.,"June 3, 2013",Reports that the 'Pawn Stars' personality has passed away are a hoax.,David Mikkelson,"Austin “Chumlee” Russell (so nicknamed by a friend’s father due to his resemblance to the character of Chumley the walrus in the Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons) is one of the stars of the popular reality show Pawn Stars, the “resident clown” of the staff at the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, where he is frequently derided by the shop’s owners, Rick Harrison and Richard “Old Man” Harrison, for being bumbling and lazy. Beginning in May 2013, a rumor was circulated on the Internet claiming that Chumlee had recently passed away from a “marijuana overdose”: In what may come to be a medical landmark, “Chumlee” Russell of Pawn Stars fame died from a marijuana overdose Monday night and was found by friend “Big Hoss” Harrison on Tuesday morning. Earlier this year, “Chumlee” was arrested with seven pounds of marijuana which he asserted were all for personal use. According to Dr. Angstrom H. Troubador, “The only possible way he could have died from a marijuana overdose without first clogging his lungs with soot is through the use of vaporizers. Reportedly, Chumlee had rigged up to 90 vaporizers into one tube and had a team of groupies constantly loading them up with the stickiest and most potent of marijuana available on the market.” Fans and family mourn the loss of “Chumlee” and have taken the opportunity to speak out against drug abuse. “To die like that, it’s just a shame,” said Rick Harrison, manager of the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, as he teared up. “It’s just a shame to lose such a fun guy as Chum. Rest in peace, buddy.”  The rumor was nothing more than a hoax, a bit of fiction promulgated in a 14 May 2013 article published on the Internet Chronicle web site, one which followed up that site’s equally fictitious report from two months earlier which claimed Chumlee had been arrested for possession of seven pounds of marijuana. (The putative cause of death given in Chumlee’s phony Internet Chronicle obituary, a “marijuana overdose,” is virtually a medical impossibility.) In March 2014, a similar spoof article published by eBuzzd (along with images of fake reaction tweets from other celebrities) spawned more false Chumlee death rumors, this time positing that the Pawn Stars personality had passed away of a heart attack: Austin Russell, also known as Chumlee, star of History’s reality series “Pawn Stars,” has died from an apparent heart attack, sources confirm to eBuzzd. He was only 31 years old. The news comes as a shock considering Chumlee’s [sic] had just recently altered his lifestyle habits, and lost 75 pounds in a year by exercising at a gym six days a week and improving his diet, including drinking more juice, eating more vegetables and abstaining from red meat, a change that was inspired by his father’s death at age 54 from pancreatic cancer, two weeks before Pawn Stars debuted. In July 2017, business2community.com revived the “marijuana overdose” death hoax:  Austin “Chumlee” Russell from “Pawn Stars” being found dead from a marijuana overdose or heart attack is a celebrity death hoax. There is no truths that the TV personality has passed away. Russell is one of the stars of the popular reality show and is just like a son to Rick Harrison. He has been around the shop since he was a kid. Everybody loves Chum, but he is often the “resident clown.” Part of the reason he is not taken seriously is that he constantly begs Corey Harrison to buy items that entertain him like video games and circus paraphernalia that usually do not make good business sense. The real Chumlee remains alive and well, as indicated by his ongoing tweets and his appearances at his  candy store in Las Vegas: Buy some candies for @somahe80 at Chumlee's candies shop.

However, Cortez Masto made it sound like Heck and Trump are lockstep on the issue, and that's clearly not the case. There are major stated policy differences between the two Republicans — Heck opposes mass deportation, which Trump campaigned on during the primary season. And Heck has supported a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country, as well as supported a version of the DREAM Act. It wasn't ""next to impossible"" to find those differences.",Riley Snyder,"National and state Democrats are trying to tie Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck to the controversial immigration policies of Donald Trump,including Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. In a recent news release, Cortez Masto’s campaign called the two Republicans ""ideological soul mates."" ""Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck,"" stated Cortez Masto’s release. With immigration being a top concern for Nevada’s sizable Hispanic population, we thought it was worth comparing the two candidates to see if it really is ""next to impossible"" to find a policy difference. Priorities On the surface level, there are many policy differences on immigration between Heck and Trump. Trump’s immigration platform is detailed on his campaign website, and centers around three topics previously distilled by PolitiFact: Build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, and require Mexico to make a one-time $5 to $10 billion payment to pay for it. Increase enforcement of immigration laws, including ending birthright citizenship and ending funding for so-called sanctuary cities. Focus on American workers, including halting green cards for foreign workers until more domestic workers are hired and increasing the minimum prevailing wage for H-1B visa program recipients. Heck’s campaign and House websites acknowledge a ""broken"" immigration system but focus on different policy solutions. While echoing Trump in calling for implementing a mandatory E-verify system for employers and calling for increased border security, Heck says he’s open to granting citizenship or legal status to people not legally in the country if his other proposals are addressed in a ""meaningful"" way. Both campaigns sent lengthy responses to PolitiFact. One thing is clear: There is daylight between Heck and Trump on a number of immigration policies. Birthright citizenship Democrats claim Heck and Trump share identical positions on wanting to ""end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment."" It’s true both Republicans have mentioned re-examining the concept of jus soli — extending citizenship based on place of birth, not parental nationality — but Heck and Trump differ on rhetoric. Trump explicitly calls for an end to the policy, calling it the ""biggest magnet for illegal immigration."" (He also cites Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid’s 1993 bill ""clarifying"" the concept, though Reid later called it the ""low point"" of his legislative career.) Heck has also called for a similar re-examination of the policy, but in a less direct tone. His most pointed comments came in 2012, where a tracker captured Heck saying he supported changing the concept. ""My personal opinion is that if you’re gonna be a citizen – be considered a citizen – you should be born to at least one parent that’s a U.S. citizen,"" he said at the time. Heck generally hasn’t gone as far since then, most recently telling a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter that ""it needs to be part of the discussion"" but stopping short of a full endorsement. Legal scholars generally agree that birthright citizenship is on solid constitutional ground, but several believe it would only take a congressional act to ""clarify"" citizenship for children born of people not legally in the United States, and point out that the court has never fully adjudicated the issue. 2013 immigration bill Cortez Masto says Heck and Trump both opposed the 2013 bipartisan immigration legislation, commonly referred to as the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. That glosses over important parts of the story. In 2013, Heck described the legislation as having positives and negatives but ultimately said he’d vote against the Senate bill as written, pointing to concerns over border security and wanting to toughen the education requirements for the children of people not legally in the country looking to apply for citizenship. The bill never received a House vote, but Heck still took independent action on the immigration bill. The Republican worked on draft legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for people illegally brought into the country as children, and publicly criticized House leadership in 2013 for failing to vote on any immigration legislation. Trump, on the other hand, told Bloomberg that he only really started following the immigration debate since he started running for president in 2015. ""When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight. … I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess,"" he said in May. This is contradicted by several tweets and interviews Trump did in 2013, calling the legislation a ""death wish"" for the Republican Party. Trump later criticized primary rival Marco Rubio’s involvement in the legislation, calling it ""nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties."" DREAMers/DACA One of Heck’s most notable forays into the immigration debate was a failed attempt to bring forward a Republican version of the long-languishing Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. Heck worked for around six months to try to find a compromise path supported by both parties, businesses and immigration activists before trying to roll out the measure in December 2013. Heck’s version of the legislation, which had a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought unlawfully into the country as children, fell flat after immigration activists and several other stakeholders declined to back the proposal over concerns that it only addressed part of the problem and wanted to hold out for a more comprehensive immigration plan. Additionally, Heck has voted against funding for Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented children and their parents to receive work permits and exemptions from deportation. He’s on the record voting for several amendments that would strip the program’s funding and voted in 2015 to block funding for an expansion of the program while joining with 25 other House Republicans to support the existing program. In the past, Heck has tried to frame his mixed voting record on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in terms of his stated opposition to the president’s use of executive orders establishing the programs. Trump is clearly opposed to the issue, and in 2015 called for the full rescission of executive orders protecting DREAMers from deportation, as well as the mass deportation of the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. He’s also publicly opposed the DREAM Act itself. Heck has routinely called Trump’s proposals unrealistic. ""I don’t think they can find, round up and afford to deport 11 million people,"" he told reporters in March. The wall/border security Heck also differs on Trump’s signature piece of immigration policy — building a massive border wall with Mexico. The Heck campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to constituents who ask about the proposed border wall. The letter stresses Heck’s commitment to border security while gently dismissing Trump’s plan for a massive, thousand-mile concrete wall as being inefficient. ""Physical barriers are certainly effective in areas with high cross-border traffic; however, there are vast stretches of our border that have relatively few crossings, and preventing these crossings could be more easily achieved through other methods,"" he says in the letter. Part of Heck’s stated reasoning for opposing the 2013 immigration bill had to do with border security — the Republican specifically called for additional border fencing and for more manpower along the border to stop illegal crossings. H1-B visas Trump and Heck also differ on what to do with temporary H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers. Trump’s plan explicitly calls to increase the minimum prevailing wage (an averaged wage paid to workers in a similar field) for H1-B recipients over fears that the program depresses wages for American workers. It also makes an unspecified point of forcing companies to hire American workers before foreign workers in the visa program. Heck’s campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to voters who ask about limiting the visas, which details Heck’s concerns that scaling back the program could hurt economic growth. ""By restricting H-1B visas, growth in the U.S. in STEM fields could be restricted,"" Heck says in the letter. Sanctuary cities Another area of immigration policy overlap for Trump and Heck is in defunding so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" or areas where local law enforcement doesn’t routinely report undocumented migrants to immigration authorities. There’s no agreed-upon or legal definition of a ""sanctuary city,"" and use of the moniker is somewhat fluid. Trump seized the issue after the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last year by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, and has forcefully called for cutting off federal grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement. While he hasn’t been as vocal as Trump, Heck did vote to block federal law enforcement funds from sanctuary cities as part of a House bill in July 2015. The White House promised to veto the measure, which has defeated in a procedural vote by Senate Democrats. Our ruling Cortez Masto claims that ""on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck."" There are areas where Heck and Trump overlap on immigration policy: mandatory E-verify for employers, upping border security and questioning birthright citizenship.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa came under criticism online for his own effort.“I don’t understand why China gets upset [because] we refer to the virus that originated there [as] the ‘Chinese virus,'” he wrote on Twitter. “Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918 & 1919.”Grassley was hit with thousands of responses in a Twitter phenomenon commonly called “the ratio,” with many of the replies correcting him on the origin of the 1918 pandemic’s name.In reality, the “Spanish flu” — a strain of H1N1 influenza — was not first detected in Spain. As sources ranging from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to the Journal of Translational Medicine have identified the midwestern United States as the likely starting point for the disease. According to a 2004 study published in the journal:Haskell County, Kansas, is the first recorded instance anywhere in the world of an outbreak of influenza so unusual that a physician warned public health officials. It remains the first recorded instance suggesting that a new virus was adapting, violently, to man.If the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no good explanation for how it arrived there. There were no other known outbreaks anywhere in the United States from which someone could have carried the disease to Haskell, and no suggestions of influenza outbreaks in either newspapers or reflected in vital statistics anywhere else in the region. And unlike the 1916 outbreak in France, one can trace with perfect definiteness the route of the virus from Haskell to the outside world.In February 2018, the The Wichita Eagle, the state’s largest newspaper, published a report commemorating the centennial of the outbreak:No one knows for sure what farm, what family may have first fallen ill. The community was most likely Santa Fe, now a ghost town in Haskell County, says Darlene Groth, curator at Haskell County Historical Society in Sublette.What is known is that a Kansas country doctor — Dr. Loring Miner, who practiced in Haskell County — became concerned when he noticed this three-day flu wasn’t typical. It was an “influenza of the severe type,” he wrote, and hit young, strong and otherwise healthy people the hardest. He was the first to report to Public Health Reports — a publication of the U.S. Public Health Service — that this flu was a killer.Furthermore, several reports have verified that the disease’s enduring nickname was derived from one of the few sources of coverage it received during World War I. According to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Preventive Medicine and Health, reports out of Spain were a function of its remarkably free press, relative to news organizations in other countries:As Spain was neutral in the First World War, newspapers there were free to report the devastating effects that the 1918 pandemic virus was having in that country. Thus, it was generally perceived that the pandemic had originated in Spain, and the infection was incorrectly dubbed “Spanish flu”. During the fall of 1918, the front pages of Spanish newspapers were filled with the names of those who had died of the pandemic in the country.In other European countries, however, the press refrained from reporting news of the spreading infection, in order to avoid alarming the general population, which was already suffering the privations caused by the First World War. On 22nd August 1918, the Italian Interior Minister denied the alarming reports of the spread of the flu pandemic, and in the following months, both national and international newspapers followed suit. Nor was censorship restricted to news of the spread of the fearsome infection; it also extended to information and comments that contrasted with the official versions of the nature of the disease.In order to avoid public alarm, several local hygiene authorities refused to reveal the numbers of people affected and deaths.Grassley’s tweet is part of a larger wave of xenophobic and racist remarks that right-wing politicians and outlets have churned out in an apparent attempt to blame China for the virus outright and change the national narrative, defying the process the World Health Organization went through in designating the disease behind the 2020 pandemic as COVID-19.“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said according to the New York Times. “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.”The Sinophobic rhetoric has made its way to the White House Twitter account:But as CNN reported, the shift was sudden; Trump only began using this particular descriptor for COVID-19 on March 16th 2020:Trump only started calling the “Chinese Virus” within the last two days.Between January and March 15th, he referred to it as the “coronavirus”, at least on Twitter anyway, 41 times.Since March 16th he hasn’t called it the “coronavirus” once. pic.twitter.com/luucCArdjA— Nathan McDermott (@natemcdermott) March 18, 2020As often happens, the political demonization dovetails with public discrimination.

17890,One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in (federal income) taxes.,"September 26, 2013","Sanders said that one out of four corporations doesn’t pay a nickel in taxes. The statement reflects a 2008 study from the Government Accountability Office. However, the GAO study did not distinguish between firms that had losses in the normal course of business and those that reported losses solely through the use of the tax code. Groups along the political spectrum give much weight to the costs of doing business that can lead to a bad year. There is wide agreement that losses in one year can be carried forward and that salaries are an unavoidable expense, to mention just two factors. Special tax breaks and abuses of the tax code exist but even an analysis from a group that shares many of Sanders’ perspectives pointed to a ratio that was, at most, one out of six and possibly as small as one out of 16. The one out of four statistic fails to take into account many relevant factors.",Jon Greenberg,"The taxes paid, or not paid, by corporations is a perennial topic in Washington. There is broad agreement that the current rules should be changed but no consensus on what those changes ought to be. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pulled out a dramatic statistic during a Sept. 24, 2013, back-and-forth with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s Crossfire. ""One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in taxes,"" Sanders said. The two senators were talking about federal income taxes, and we decided we should check to see if Sanders’ claim is accurate. In the context of his debate with Graham, the implication is that if it weren't for special deals in the tax code, these companies would be writing checks to the Internal Revenue Service. Sanders' office pointed us to a Government Accountability Office study from 2008. The GAO conducts analysis for Congress. In one sense, that study found that Sanders understated the situation. For all corporations, about two-thirds, or about 1.2 million, paid no federal income taxes in 2005. But many of those firms are quite small -- an owner and a couple of employees. For large U.S.-controlled corporations, those with at least $250 million in assets or $50 million in gross receipts, one out of four paid no taxes, as Sanders said. The total revenues for those large companies was about $1.08 trillion. That, however, is not the end of the story. Why they owe no taxes We will focus on the large corporations because those seemed to be the ones Sanders had in mind. The GAO study found that 80 percent of those firms reported no income at the point in their tax return when they subtracted salaries and wages and took other deductions. That is, they showed a gross profit based on selling items for more than it cost to produce them, but they had additional expenses after that, such as payroll and tax deductions, which drove their taxable income to zero. The GAO lumped together firms that paid no taxes because they failed to turn a profit and those that were profitable but used additional wrinkles in the tax code to avoid paying the government. Distinguishing between those two groups sheds light on the situation. Citizens for Tax Justice is a research group that has as one of its goals ""requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share."" It has written in defense of Sanders’ positions before, but its most recent study of corporate tax payments suggests that the one-in-four statistic might be less significant than it seems. Steve Wamhoff, the group’s legislative director, said their 2011 report started with the Fortune 500 companies and culled the ones that met two criteria: they had three consecutive years of profitability from 2008 to 2010, and they provided enough information to do an accurate analysis. Of the 500, 220 did not meet those standards. With some notable exceptions, such as Google and Microsoft, the primary reason those 220 companies fell off the list was they had real losses. ""We get the fact that if you have profits one year but not the next year, you would carry your losses forward,"" Wamhoff said. ""We get that, but if you’ve been profitable for three years straight, those are the ones who really should be paying taxes."" Of the 280 consistently profitable corporations that remained, the study found that 22 paid no taxes in 2008, 49 paid none in 2009, and 37 paid none in 2010. Across all three years, there were 30 corporations that had a tax rate of zero or even a negative rate. The negative rate meant they might get a rebate check from Washington or have a tax credit they could apply to future earnings. Many familiar names show up in this list, such as Wells Fargo, Boeing, Verizon and General Electric. In the study’s three-year span, those 30 companies had pre-tax profits of about $160 billion, but their direct contribution to the federal treasury was zero. Citizens for Tax Justice pointed the finger at the rules for accelerated depreciation and stock options. The report said these and various other deductions allowed the firms to avoid hefty tax bills. However, those policy matters fall outside the scope of this fact check. A lack of profits tends to reduce the tax bill For fact-checking purposes, the Citizens for Tax Justice findings are interesting for another reason. If pre-tax losses explain why a large number of firms would not owe the government money, then the meaning of Sanders’ claim begins to look quite different. We would not expect a firm without profits to pay taxes. The GAO study did not probe this deeply. The Citizens for Tax Justice did, albeit for a smaller group of corporations. In rough terms, out of the original 500 corporations, 220 or about 40 percent were dealing with losses. The study found 78 consitently profitable companies, or about 15 percent of the original 500, that paid no taxes in at least one year. That is less than one out of four; it’s closer to one out of six. If we look at the 30 that paid nothing in any year, the ratio drops to one out of 16. Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, generally seen as a centrist think tank, cautions against reading too much into the 2008 GAO study. In a blog post written shortly after it was released, he called it ""interesting and suggestive, though also not conclusive."" Toder noted that most corporations are quite small with gross receipts of less than $250,000. They report no income because the money turns up as paychecks to the owner and employers where it is subject to the individual income tax. He agreed that some large corporations use ""aggressive techniques to shift reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions,"" but even those end up paying some U.S. taxes. Toder’s bottom line on the one out of four statistic? ""Whatever the technical factual basis of the statement, it isn’t terribly meaningful or revealing."" William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a group that promotes lower taxes, finds Sanders’ ratio ""misleading."" McBride, as do the other analysts we contacted, pointed to the costs of doing business. His list included salaries and wages, interest, depreciation, rent and other taxes. ""You cannot legitimately deny these businesses these write-offs,"" McBride said. Our ruling Sanders said that one out of four corporations doesn’t pay a nickel in taxes. The statement reflects a 2008 study from the Government Accountability Office. However, the GAO study did not distinguish between firms that had losses in the normal course of business and those that reported losses solely through the use of the tax code.

27765,"Getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can, in rare cases, increase the chances of a stroke.","March 25, 2016","Just don’t bend your neck back, literally, at all. It can be something as simple as saying, “put five or six towels down.” Don’t bend your neck back, no matter how comfortable you are, or what your stylist says.",Brooke Binkowski,"In January 2014, a woman in San Diego, California, went to a local salon to get her hair done. What happened next sounds like the most nightmarish of urban legends: the angle and degree she was tilted in the chair and the way her head tipped back over the sink while the stylist was washing her hair caused Elizabeth Smith to have a stroke two weeks later: “I vomited, my head became hot and I couldn’t stand. I had weakness in my arms and legs. They didn’t think I was going to live,” said Smith, choking back tears. Smith says she could hardly believe what nearly killed her. Her doctors pointed to her time in the shampoo chair. Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome is what they called it. It’s a rare but documented condition. Multiple doctors who saw Smith say when her neck was bent backwards, it hyperextended, her vertebrae slicing an artery. A clot began forming, later causing a stroke. “Several of Ms. Smith’s neurologists confirmed with her that the stroke was caused by the vertebra dissecting her artery during her hair wash,” said Smith’s attorney Carree Nahama. The danger is real, although the probability of it happening is low. A study that came out in 1993, subsequently covered by the New York Times, found that older people have a higher risk of a stroke during or after a visit to the beauty salon (Smith was in her late 40s at the time): The patients suffered from a variety of complaints attributable to poor blood flow in arteries leading through the neck to the back of the brain, including severe dizziness, imbalance and facial numbness. Four out of five suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage. “In older people, neck motion beyond a certain degree can be extremely dangerous, particularly hyperextension and rotation,” said Dr. Weintraub, chief of neurology at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y., referring to backward arching and twisting. He and others have suggested that patients receiving anesthesia or undergoing prolonged dental work may also be vulnerable, since they too have their necks arched back abnormally for prolonged periods. A 2006 study also looked into the issue, saying while it probably occurred more than previously thought, the risk of stroke in these cases was easily alleviated: Taken together, hyperextension combined with hanging the head backwards in a hair washbasin can be seen as a risk factor for posterior circulation ischemia. It probably occurs more often than assumed and a number of patients may report about previous dizziness episodes under the same conditions when asked specifically. It can be prevented by changing the shampoo routine from the hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position. Dr. Scott Olson, a vascular neurologist at the University of California, San Diego, told us that while he hasn’t seen this specific case, he has seen this particular injury (more commonly called a “vertebral artery dissection,” which can lead to subsequent clotting and stroke) and it’s not unprecedented: It’s pretty much a fluke. I have seen people who’ve had this happen while surfing, they happen after dental visits. I had an auto mechanic who was working on a car for a day and had his head hanging over a creeper… I had a patient fall asleep in a movie theater and ended up having a dissection. [But] …It’s like a lot of things in life where it’s the same thing you’ve done. I think people should not be inordinately worried about it. I mean, tens of thousands of people across this country have their hair washed at salons every day. It’s very statistically uncommon. He says there are signs to watch for after a potential injury: Things people should pay attention to, should be concerned about? Pain on one side of the neck after extension, and obviously, any neurologic symptoms like vertigo. There’s some genetic disorders, like Marfan Syndrome, hyperextensible joints, or connective tissue disease that will make you more prone. Elizabeth Smith says she racked up $250,000 in medical bills and has permanently lost part of her vision and mobility. She is now suing the salon for damages. On 30 March 2016, we spoke to Smith. She told us: I had no idea that the story would go on, and I’m glad that it has. The two big skepticisms really are — people think that you feel something, but you feel nothing, because your artery has no nerves, so you feel nothing when it happens. So just because you’re like “oh, I’m comfortable,” doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened. The other thing is that the delay from injury to stroke is because you get a little bit of a bleed, and a little bleed won’t clog or occlude your artery. It takes your body time to build a clot big enough to do the damage, roughly two weeks. For me, it was 8 days, but that wasn’t the full stroke.","http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/news/rare-threat-of-stroke-at-the-beauty-salon.html, http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/90449, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-beauty-parlor-stroke-syndrome-real/, http://www.10news.com/news/local-woman-shampoo-session-at-salon-nearly-turned-deadly-022516, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/761451-overview, http://neurosurgery.ucsd.edu/scott-olson-md/, http://abcnews.go.com/Health/woman-shampoo-stylist-led-beauty-parlor-stroke/story?id=37233875, http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=405646&resultclick=1",true,"Uncategorized, beauty parlor stroke syndrome, salon, stroke"
10257,Busting the vitamin C myth,"July 18, 2007","This report does a good job of using a recent, credible report to debunk the myth that taking vitamin C can prevent or treat colds. The segment uses its medium fairly well to deliver the key message. The piece has two major weaknesses. First, it fails to make clear the distinction between the benefits of vitamin C supplements and whole foods rich in the vitamin. More important is the overstatement the physician-journalist made about the possiblilty the vitamin itself can help prevent cancer. This is a major error that can mislead viewers about a very serious condition. (This problem is compounded at the end of the piece when the host says, ""I’m still taking vitamin C,"" without any challenge from the physician-journalist.) At the end of the piece, the host tells viewers that more information is available from its online partner, WebMD. This is commendable, a best practice in broadcast medical news. The WebMD article does indeed provide additional details about the Cochrane report that can help viewers understand the topic better."," ","Information about how much it would cost to take the vitamin prophylactically for a year would have made a useful point–taking vitamin C isn’t just ineffective, it’s costly. It would also have been good to report how much money Americans spend on vitamin C products to treat colds–not just the supplements but lozenges, often-expensive vitamin C products marketed for cold treatment, etc. The physician-journalist accurately describes the findings in a way people can easily understand on television–essentially that there is no benefit of taking C in preventing colds, with the exception of one key subgoup of little relevance to most Americans. Given the nature of the findings, more precise quantification is not needed. The report fails to indicate that taking high levels of vitamin C, as some advocates suggest, can have serious health consequences, from dental erosion to kidney toxicity. It can also interact with aspirin and other drugs. The story looked at numerous trials that passed a high quality bar. It also identified the source of the information well. But the physician-reporter added a worrisome note that ""it [vitamin C] may even help prevent cancer for sure."" This is a broad, potentially misleading overstatement for which no evidence is given. In fact, the American Cancer Society makes clear that diets rich in fruits and vegetables, which are high in vitamin C and many other nutrients, are believed to reduce risk of cancer. The ACS makes clear that there is no evidence linking the vitamin itself to reduced cancer risk. This problem is compounded at the end of the piece when the host says, ""I’m still taking vitamin C,"" without any challenge from the physician-journalist. The report does not exaggerate the risks of the common cold. The segment accurately indicates the high crediblity of the Cochrane group, and there appear to be no underlying conflicts of interest that would call the conclusions into question. When the discussion shifts to the importance of adequate intake of vitamin C, the physician-journalist fails to make sufficiently clear that the known benefits of vitamin C are from eating whole foods high in the vitamin. Thus the viewer does not fully understand that eating these foods is a wise alternative to taking the supplements. The report ends nicely with the note that the only proven method of reducing colds risk is to wash hands. Vitamin C supplements are widely available. The report accurately describes vitamin C as widely used. Like most media reports of this study, this one drew heavily on the Cochrane abstract itself. It shares some language with other reports, but not in a way that demonstrates lack of rigor."," ",mixture," "
4624,UN demands immediate halt to attacks in Ebola areas in Congo.,,"The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday called on armed groups jeopardizing the response to an Ebola outbreak in Congo to immediately halt their attacks, expressing “great concern” at the potential regional spread of the often deadly virus."," Edith M. Lederer","A resolution adopted unanimously by the U.N.’s most powerful body condemned the attacks “in the strongest terms,” especially “those posing serious security risks for responders.” It singled out Allied Democratic Forces rebels. The council said the security situation in areas affected by the Ebola outbreak “is severely hampering the response efforts and facilitating the spread of the virus” in Congo and the region. Members cited a World Health Organization warning and expressed “great concern about the potential for the virus to spread into Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Burundi.” The resolution adopted by the council demanded that all parties “ensure full, safe, immediate and unhindered access for humanitarian and medical personnel” to Ebola-affected areas. This is the first time an Ebola outbreak has occurred in Congo’s far northeast, where multiple rebel groups are active. Last week, the ministry of health said teams responding to the Ebola outbreak are attacked three or four times a week on average, a level of violence unseen in the country’s nine previous outbreaks of the virus. Ebola is spread via the body fluids of infected people, including the dead. The health ministry said Monday there were 239 confirmed cases and 35 probable cases. At least 120 people have died. In trying to contain the outbreak, which was declared on Aug. 1, health experts have faced resistance from wary communities, with infected people slipping away. Safe burials are often flashpoints where families bristle at outsiders telling them how to say goodbye to loved ones. In one example of the rumors that pose challenges to containing the virus, the health ministry said this month that 22 young people in the northeastern city of Butembo dug up an Ebola victim and opened the body bag to verify that health workers had not taken organs from the body. The resolution adopted by the council emphasized the need for Congo’s government and those providing assistance “to enhance efforts to communicate to the public” and implement safety and health protocols and preventive measures. This will “mitigate against misinformation and undue alarm about the transmission and extent of the outbreak among and between individuals and communities,” the council said. The resolution also underscored the need to step up engagement with local communities and work closely with religious leaders, youth and women’s groups, and affected families, including on resuming humanitarian assistance. The Security Council also emphasized that “men and women are affected differently by the Ebola outbreak” and the response must address their different needs. It urged international support to bring the Ebola outbreak under control. Ethiopia’s U.N. Ambassador Tekeda Alemu said it is “vital” that the international community provides flexible financial support “to enable a more rapid response.” Sweden’s U.N, deputy ambassador Carl Skau said the resolution “sends a clear, coherent and comprehensive message of support to all those involved in the front-line response efforts, on the ground in (Congo) and in neighboring countries.”"," ",true,"Africa, Burundi, Health, United Nations, South Sudan"
5909,Minnesota environmentalists aren’t excited about DFL’s wins.,,Minnesota’s most influential environmental organizations are often politically aligned with the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. But many of those groups aren’t feeling particularly victorious after the DFL’s big victories earlier this month.," Walker Orenstein Of Minnpost.","That’s because they don’t expect much change when it comes to two of the state’s most fiercely contested natural resources projects: PolyMet’s proposed copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota and the plan to replace an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that enters the state from Canada and North Dakota and ends near Lake Superior. Several environmental organizations opposing PolyMet and the Enbridge Line 3 project say DFLer Tim Walz, Gov. Mark Dayton’s successor, is unlikely to dramatically change course for the mine or pipeline, even if he supports many of their other causes. “Right now I’m not seeing any indication that there’s going to be a message to change what’s been going on in any kind of significant way,” said Scott Strand, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center. --- The nonprofit news outlet MinnPost provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News. --- The PolyMet project took a leap forward earlier this month when the Department of Natural Resources granted it key environmental permits. The DNR’s long-awaited decision was celebrated by many who see the $1 billion project as a source of jobs, but the plan has been fought tooth-and-nail by some environmentalists worried its waste could pollute Lake Superior and the surrounding watershed. Dayton has put up some hurdles for the Enbridge project. His Department of Commerce has been vocal in its opposition. He also vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline to move ahead without typical approval from the Public Utilities Commission, though the five-member PUC board — made up of three Democrats, a Republican and a nonpartisan member — approved the project in June anyway. The PUC recently unanimously rejected petitions to reconsider that decision, leading protesters to march to Walz’s new office at the Capitol. As governor, Walz won’t be able to unilaterally stop either project. But as Strand noted, some state agencies need to approve permits for Enbridge and said more robust opposition from Walz could influence them, even if Walz can’t “preordain” an outcome. (Legal battles over the PUC decision are likely to reach the state Supreme Court, too.) Aaron Klemz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA), said he believes a new DNR under Walz could restart the environmental review process based on MCEA’s assertion that PolyMet is planning to build a much bigger mine than it has proposed. Dayton has supported PolyMet. That project also needs additional permits before it can open. Walz maintains PolyMet should move forward if the company’s plan meets state environmental standards. He has a similar stance on the Enbridge Line 3 replacement, but Walz spokeswoman Kayla Castaneda said in an email there “must be meaningful engagement with all the tribes affected by the project,” especially the ones opposed to it. The proposed route for the pipeline doesn’t cross any tribal land, but it would span wild rice waters tribes have rights to, and areas with cultural importance. “When it comes to a project that could impact our environment, I believe we need to follow the science,” Walz said in a written statement. “If a project meets or exceeds all environmental standards, then it should be permitted. If it does not, it should not.” Environmental groups have been eagerly waiting to see whom Walz appoints to lead key agencies as a signal of how his administration may approach PolyMet, Enbridge and other projects. Castaneda said Walz’s Cabinet choices are expected to be announced in mid-December. But many say they’re not holding their breath for commissioners with an environmentalist slant. “There’s nothing that’s been promised on the campaign trail that would suggest that he’s been any different than Dayton has been,” Klemz said. Tara Houska, campaigns director for Honor the Earth, an organization fighting Enbridge, said Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan’s strong opposition to the pipeline has sparked optimism that the Walz administration will follow suit. But she criticized Walz, saying he has not been clear enough in his position on the pipeline and said she hopes Flanagan’s stance and status as a member of the White Earth Nation “translates to action” and isn’t simply “political cover.” Houska noted Michigan’s incoming Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has been flatly against replacing an Enbridge pipeline in her state. Supporters of the Enbridge project in Minnesota say a new pipeline would be safer than the old one and its construction would create jobs in rural Minnesota. Enbridge says the existing pipeline is not operating at full capacity because of safety worries. Opponents worry about spills and other possible environmental problems with a new pipeline, and are urging an end to projects that support fossil fuels amid escalating global temperatures. The frustration of Minnesota’s environmental groups illustrates their lack of political traction on PolyMet and Enbridge, as well as the split inside the DFL between those favoring economic development through jobs in natural resource industries versus those concerned about potential damage to the environment. PolyMet has been supported by most prominent Republicans and DFLers, who say the project can be done safely. The company has promised hundreds of jobs, a claim that’s been backed up by some research, and the DNR is satisfied with PolyMet’s pollution-protection measures. The state has also secured financial promises from PolyMet in case of trouble, although some have questioned whether it’s enough money to fix a disaster. Environmentalists still do support much of Walz’s agenda. For instance, Walz been skeptical of another project, a potential Twin Metals copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and the Boundary Waters Action Fund ran ads to support him. Castaneda took pains to show the concerns of environmental organizations are not sidelined. She said Walz’s administration is reaching out to pro-industry and environmental groups for input to build bridges and garner advice for Cabinet appointees. For now, the MCEA and other environmental groups will continue their fight to stop Enbridge Line 3 and PolyMet largely with lawsuits, protests and outside lobbying of state government. Not all environmental groups are discouraged. Margaret Levin, state director for the Sierra Club’s North Star Chapter, struck a hopeful tone when interviewed by MinnPost. Though her chapter has been opposed to the PolyMet and Enbridge projects, she didn’t criticize Walz or other DFLers directly. Levin said the Walz administration has “potential” to help the state “come together around long-term economic growth and sustainability that will be truly sustainable and clean and equitable.” She also singled out Flanagan’s opposition to Enbridge as positive. “I think that the governor-elect is a populist and understands and appreciates the power in the grassroots,” Levin said.",https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2018/11/why-some-minnesota-environmentalists-arent-more-excited-about-the-dfls-big-election-wins/,true,"Lake Superior, Environment, Mark Dayton, Minnesota"
17128,"More ""25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America.","April 15, 2014","Wynn said more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America. Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities. But four major metro areas, led by Washington, D.C., netted more new residents in the cited age group in the latest three years checked by Brookings demographer James Frey. The Austin area ranked fifth among the nation’s major metros. We see no basis for currently declaring Austin No. 1, but Wynn's claim has an element of truth; the Austin area was the biggest draw for young adults in some recent three-year periods.",W. Gardner Selby,"Former Austin Mayor Will Wynn, who often speaks on urban growth, suggested that Austin’s attractiveness to retirees and young Americans helps explain demand for downtown housing. ""As our society ages, and as boomers start retiring by the millions, we’re going to see a dramatic increase in the demand for dense urban multifamily housing, with a broad mix of uses nearby,"" Wynn told the Austin American-Statesman for a March 30, 2014, news story headlined ""Austin’s rebuilding boom."" ""Couple that with the fact that more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America,"" Wynn said, ""and you’ve got yourself a hell of a strong demand for urban housing. I tell people that by any way you possibly measure it — quality of life, public safety, environmental sustainability, public health and fitness, economic — mixed-use density is literally the answer."" Density preferences aside, is Wynn right that more young adults are moving to Austin than to any other U.S. city? Wynn recalls a newspaper story By phone and email, Wynn said he learned of Austin’s draw from a Statesman news story citing U.S Census Bureau research. He didn’t have the story handy, but we found a March 30, 2013, Statesman news story stating that analyses of U.S Census Bureau data by William Frey, a senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that from 2009 through 2011, the Austin metro area drew more Americans in the cited age span than any other U.S. city--just as the area did the previous three years, the story said. Frey, the newspaper said, measured rates for annual average net migration (including people who left Austin) of young adults ages 25 to 34 and young adults with college degrees. ""Austin hits the trifecta,"" Frey said then. ""It's got jobs, cachet, it's got people who see that it's a pathway to careers, either because they go there to get an education or to use an education."" Frey further said jobs typically are the top reason people move. Twenty-somethings traditionally have the highest rates of mobility, and college graduates typically are more willing to move out of state for jobs because they tend to compete for them in national markets, Frey said then. Updated analysis places Austin-Round Rock fifth But there's been a change in the rankings, according to Frey’s Nov. 15, 2013, analysis of more recent census data. The Austin-Round Rock metro area placed fifth among 51 major metro areas as a draw on ""millennials,"" adults in the cited age group, from 2009 through 2012, according to a chart posted online by Brookings. Over those three years, the Austin-Round Rock area had an average annual gain of 8,061 25- to 34-year-olds, Frey wrote. Washington, D.C., ranked first among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 12,583 people in the age group, he wrote. Also, the Denver, Portland, Ore., and Houston areas netted greater gains than the Austin area, according to Frey’s breakdown. On the Brookings site, Frey described the D.C. results as a ""renewal of young adults in the post-recession period… compared to the loss of young adults during the recession. The existence of both government and non-government employment opportunities in a highly educated ‘millennial friendly’ environment make the nation’s capital an attractive destination until migration flows to a broader group of areas emerge. ""A few other areas, including San Francisco and Minneapolis, have showed a rising post-recession young adult boom as well,"" Frey wrote. His chart shows the San Francisco area ranked sixth among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 7,688 such young adults in the three years. The Minneapolis area, 11th among major metros, had an average annual gain of 3,708 adults in the age group, according to the chart. Researcher says No. 5 isn't so bad To our inquiry, Frey said by email that while Austin’s rank fell between the cited time periods, there is another way to compare--by the rate of change in such adults settling in major metro areas. By that measure, Frey added, the Austin-Round Rock area’s 2.7 net gain per 100 25- to 34-year-olds placed it second among major metros only to the Denver area, which had a 3.0 rate, he said. Still, Frey said he considers numeric gains to be a more accurate measure of where migrants are going. Numeric gains, he said, are ""not affected by the size of the destination population  In other words, among all the places in the country, which places are gaining the biggest aggregate numbers of migrants? The rate, is more of an ‘impact’ measure: how are recent migrants affecting the destination population?"" Generally, Frey said, the Austin area ""has both educational and employment opportunities relevant to young people who are looking to advance -- especially during a period when many other places have taken sharp employment hits. Even if young people coming to Austin are not getting their dream jobs right away, they will be networking with others who might make that happen. This will not be the case in many other places."" We wondered why Austin’s rank slipped. Frey said that as the economy ""slowly revives elsewhere, there will  be competitors, but being number two or number five"" isn’t bad, he wrote. Wynn, apprised of the Austin area’s latest ranking, speculated by email that Austin by itself, rather than the metro area, draws more young adults than any other U.S. city. Our ruling Wynn said more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America. Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities. But four major metro areas, led by Washington, D.C., netted more new residents in the cited age group in the latest three years checked by Brookings demographer James Frey.

Most hippos live about 30 to 40 years in the wild, and up to 50 in zoos. “This is a very sad loss for Denver Zoo and our community. Bert was a member of our family for more than 50 years,” zoo President and Chief Executive Shannon Block said. “He will be missed by all of us, including the many families and children who visited him and came to know his charismatic personality over the years,” Block said in the statement. The zoo said Bertie’s appetite had recently decreased noticeably, and that he had become less consistently interested in training sessions with his keepers. He also became more reluctant to leave his pool and showed some difficulty walking. The zoo said veterinarians were limited in their treatment options because he had not responded well to medications. Diagnosing problems in hippos is particularly difficult because of their size and anatomy, the zoo said, but all of Bertie’s symptoms pointed to severe old age. Ultimately, the zoo said, his caretakers knew that his quality of life would not improve. “This is never an easy decision, but it was the right one,” said the zoo’s Vice President of Veterinary Medicine Scott Larsen. “We’ll all miss him very much, but were glad he lived such a long, happy life here at the zoo.”   Bertie arrived in 1958 from New York’s Central Park Zoo. He is the father of every hippo calf born at Denver Zoo, which said he had sired 29 offspring with two mates. One of them, Bertie’s 12-year-old son, Mahali, is the only hippo now at the zoo."," ",true,Environment
980,EU court orders countries take hard line on air quality.,"June 26, 2019","The European Union’s top court ruled on Wednesday that cities needed to act if pollution levels were exceeded in a single black spot rather than based on an average across a region, taking a hard line in a case brought by Brussels residents.",Daphne Psaledakis,"European governments are facing pressure to reduce the level of pollution in cities to address growing concerns about the long-term damage to public health of exposure to pollutants, particularly those from vehicle diesel engines. A report released last year by the European Court of Auditors said that air pollution causes about 400,000 premature deaths each year in the EU and hundreds of billions of euros in health-related external costs. EU law requires countries to assess the level, notably in urban areas, of a range of pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter, and take action if certain limits are hit. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to rule in a case brought against Brussels by residents and campaign group ClientEarth over the region’s air quality plan. The ECJ judgment came a day after a ground-breaking ruling where a local court said France was responsible for air pollution in the Ile-de-France region around Paris, although it did not award damages to a mother and daughter who had suffered respiratory ailments. The ECJ said that while authorities could choose where to conduct sampling, this needed to include the most polluted areas and concluded that the average measurement from different parts of the city did not show the exposure to pollutants. To determine whether a limit had been reached in a calendar year it was sufficient if the pollution level was higher than the limit at a single sampling point, the ECJ said. It also found that national courts were empowered to review the location of air quality stations and could order local authorities to make sure they are located appropriately. “The ostrich-like approach, where some authorities try to hide the real extent of pollution rather than ensure their citizens breathe clean air, must stop,” Jens Muller, air quality manager at Brussels-based campaign group Transport and Environment, said in a statement."," ",true,Environment

6408,America’s air isn’t getting cleaner as fast as it used to.,,"For decades America’s air was getting cleaner as levels of a key smog ingredient steadily dropped. That changed about seven years ago when pollution reductions leveled off, a new study found."," Seth Borenstein","This means when tighter federal air quality standards go into effect later this year, many more cities may find themselves on the dirty air list. There are several reasons for the flattening of nitrogen oxide levels including hard-to-reduce industrial and truck pollution, said study co-author Helen Worden, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The study, in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used satellite and ground measurements to track nitrogen oxides, a major ingredient in smog. Levels fell 7 percent from 2005 to 2009, but only dropped 1.7 percent from 2011 to 2015. “We can’t say anymore it’s going down,” Worden said. The results also show the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s computer models overestimate how clean the air really is, said University of North Carolina’s Jason West, who wasn’t part of the study. Smog is created when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds cook in sunlight. Those chemicals come from cars, trucks, power and industrial plants. In 2015, the EPA proposed new air quality standards limiting smog levels to 70 parts per billion, down from the current 75 parts per billion. Those rules are slated to go into effect this fall, but that has been delayed once already. More than 170 counties in the United States are already exceeding the older clean air standard for smog, according to the EPA. Worden and colleagues tried to figure out what was happening, ruling out the flow of the smog ingredient from China since levels in that country went down since it tightened its air quality rules. While the 2008 recession may have played a role in the slowdown, Worden said there were other bigger factors at play. The biggest and easiest pollution reductions have already been achieved, leaving smaller, more difficult cuts, Worden said. University of Maryland air scientist Ross Salawitch said exposure to elevated ozone can lead to coughing and difficulty breathing, and make respiratory diseases such as asthma worse. For Worden, who lived in Los Angeles in the early 2000s when it was smoggier than it is now, she would bicycle to work and check ozone levels daily. If smog levels were high, “it would really make my lungs burn,” she said. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

2791,Drug critic slams FDA over antibiotic oversight in meat production.,"January 28, 2014","The United States Food and Drug Administration allowed 18 animal drugs to stay on the market even after an agency review found the drugs posed a “high risk” of exposing humans to antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food supply, according to a study released Monday by the Natural Resources Defense Council.","P.J. Huffstutter, Brian Grow","The study by the NRDC, a non-governmental group that criticizes the widespread use of drugs in the meat industry, is the latest salvo in the national debate over the long-standing practice of antibiotic use in meat production. Agribusinesses say animal drugs help increase production and keep prices low for U.S. consumers, while consumer advocates and some scientists raise concerns over antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The FDA stirred the debate late last year when it unveiled guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotic use as a growth enhancer in livestock. The agency said those guidelines were an effort to stem the surge in human resistance to certain antibiotics. But the NRDC’s study found the FDA took no action to remove 30 antibiotic-based livestock feed products from the market even after federal investigators determined many of those antibiotics fell short of current regulatory standards for protecting human health. NRDC studied a review conducted by the FDA from 2001 to 2010 that focused on 30 penicillin and tetracycline-based antibiotic feed additives. The drugs had been approved by regulators to be used specifically for growth promotion of livestock and poultry - essentially to produce more meat to sell. The FDA, in a statement, said it began a review of older, approved penicillin and tetracycline products in 2001, and issued letters to companies who made the products asking for additional safety data. “Based on its review of this and other information, the Agency chose to employ a strategy that would more broadly address the concerns about the production use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals,” the FDA said. Some academics specializing in antibiotic resistance criticized the NRDC’s study, saying that the findings do not reflect current regulatory standards because some of the drugs have been withdrawn from the market. They also say that the study assessed FDA safety guidelines that have been replaced with more stringent standards. Dr. Randall Singer, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota, told Reuters that drug makers and the U.S. livestock industry are phasing out antibiotics used principally for growth promotion. “We have been telling (both of) them for years to be prepared for the elimination of growth promotion and feed efficiency labeling because you cannot make that change overnight,” said Singer, who reviewed the NRDC report for Reuters. The NRDC, which reviewed more than 3,000 pages of documents through a federal Freedom of Information Act request, said it found evidence to suggest nine of the drugs are still on the market and used by livestock producers. Reuters was not able to independently verify that detail immediately. One of the drugs still on the market is animal health company Zoetis Inc’s Penicillin G Procaine 50/100, which is fed to poultry in part to aid in weight gain. The NRDC says the FDA twice laid out its concerns to that drug maker that the product failed to meet safety regulations. The unnamed original sponsor of the drug apparently disputed the regulators’ findings, according to excerpts from a 1997 letter sent to the FDA and included in documents obtained by the NRDC. A spokeswoman for Zoetis, a unit of Pfizer Inc that owns the drug today, said the company already is working to phase out use of the drug for growth promotion as part of the new FDA guidelines and is planning to relabel the drug for more limited purposes. Once companies remove farm-production uses of their antibiotics from drug labels, it would become illegal for those drugs to be used for those purposes, Deputy FDA Commissioner Michael Taylor told reporters recently. Although the program is meant to be voluntary, Taylor said the FDA would be able to take regulatory action against companies that fail to comply. In its statement on Monday, the FDA said it is “confident that its current strategy to protect the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials, including penicillins and tetracyclines, is the most efficient and effective way to change the use of these products in animal agriculture.”  NRDC attorney Avinash Kar, one of the study’s authors, said the group’s findings raise questions about whether regulators will be effective in enforcing the new guidelines. “The FDA’s failure to act on its own findings about the 30 reviewed antibiotic feed additives is part of a larger pattern of delay and inaction in tackling livestock drug use that goes back four decades,” Kar told Reuters."," ",true,Health News

And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she’d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson. For that moment he was just a horse’s astrophysicist. Although Larson didn’t provide a link to the purported dressing down administered by Tyson, it wasn’t difficult to locate the source of his claim — a 1 December 2015 item published by the satirical web site ClickHole describing a purported interaction between an 8-year-old girl and Tyson: Get ready for the most incredible science win ever, delivered by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson. He’s pretty much the king when it comes to shutting down people who peddle bad science, but this most recent case completely takes the cake: When an 8-year-old told the badass astrophysicist that she wanted to live on Jupiter, he completely shut her down using science. Amazing! How many times can Neil deGrasse Tyson win the internet? The epic science burn happened toward the end of one of Neil’s lectures at the Hayden Planetarium in New York last weekend. Third-grader Liza Collins was attending the lecture with her parents, and during the Q&A session, she raised her hand and told Neil that she wanted to live on Jupiter. But Neil wasn’t about to let her—and her bunk science—off the hook. “Hold on, you want to live where?” Tyson said. “On a planet made entirely of unbreathable gases? One that doesn’t even have a rocky surface you could stand on? A planet that would take you six years to even get to? That’s where you want to live? Because that’s Jupiter. Enjoy your great new home!” And of course, Neil didn’t let it end there. After the event, the Cosmos host took to Twitter to really show Liza what’s what. The ClickHole piece also included screenshots of what looked to be tweets sent by Tyson: Larson didn’t appear to be aware that ClickHole is a satirical site (an offshoot of The Onion) and that none of its content was meant to be taken seriously. Each page bears a disclaimer subtly indicating as much: ClickHole uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. ClickHole is not intended for readers under 18 years of age. A lengthy comment appended to the ClickHole article has been attributed to Tyson, but it isn’t clear if the remarks were genuinely his. (Tyson did not link to the column on Twitter nor reference it on any platform we were able to locate.) The comment (which, if inauthentic, replicated the astrophysicist’s tone quite well) countered: Hello Neal First, I’ll forgive you for not spelling your name correctly. Second, and more importantly, I don’t mind being labeled a horse’s astrophysicist (I see what you did there), provided it’s based on factual information. So what we must do is subtract the false information from your article, and then re-assess what name you choose to call me. If it still justifies “horse’s astrophysicist”, then so be it. 1) FYI: The cosmic perspective is all about having a second look at what, on the surface appears to be important, special, ego-boosting, etc. The Olympic medal count is not immune from this analysis. In fact an even better measure is medals per GDP per capita. This will tell you how efficiently and effectively a country is spending its wealth on athletic excellence. The Tweet, though based only on population, was a playful plea that we could be winning even more medals than we are. 2) I am agnostic, and actively disavow the atheist label: [Audio: 6m30s]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnHY1cC9a4A [Video: 3m 48s] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos 3) People who deny human-induced climate change are badly misinformed. This position is neither politically Liberal nor Conservative. It’s factual. Although one could argue that all those who want to preserve the environment are the real conservatives in this discussion. 4) You use “Liberal” as a tag to characterize my politics. Since I have no active public political position, that’s a hard task to accomplish. Climate change deniers are misinformed. But so are people who think vaccines gives you autism. And so are people who think genetically modified foods are bad for you.

It looks to be a hoax. No such tweets ever existed on November 29th, 2015, or on any other day. My only tweet on November 29, 2015 (as my followers can attest, and as anyone can see from scrolling my Twitter page was: Starship Enterprise versus Millennium Falcon. Oh yeah, I went there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMH1vDDd1xc So you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else’s article, before using it as a foundational pillar in yours. 6) I am 3x appointed by President George W. Bush, serving on commissions to advise him on the future of the American aerospace Industry, on NASA, and on the annual Presidential Medial of science winners. So your disapproval of my views is not shared by others on the conservative spectrum. 7) Lastly: my research output as a scientist is not hidden. You can find it here, if you are interested: http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/curriculum-vitae So when you factor in (or simply subtract) all these elements from your writeup, If what remains still justifies labeling me a horses astrophysicist, then, as I said, I’m okay with that.

Before he starts cutting hair, Maulanasyah sprays his  protective gear and his customers’ hands with sanitizer. He has worn the gear for the past two weeks as part of efforts to cut the risks from the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus that has killed at least 240 people and infected nearly 3,000 in the world’s fourth most populous country.

In Jakarta, 130 medical workers have been infected, according to the city government said. Jakarta has ordered businesses and schools to close in a bid to contain the virus and it plans large-scale social restrictions enforced by security personnel.

2384,China detains man for spreading 'panic' with bird flu rumors.,"February 12, 2014","Police in central China have detained a man who spread “panic” with a graphic rumor about the arrival of bird flu in his home province, state media reported on Wednesday."," ","Wild rumours abound on Chinese social media sites, driven in part by a broad belief that the government always seeks to cover up bad news and that state media are untrustworthy. The man detained by authorities, who was identified only by his surname, Zhou, and hails from the central province of Hubei, posted the rumor over the weekend via the popular mobile messaging platform Wechat, the official Xinhua news agency said. “The post was spread widely among netizens and aroused panic among the public,” it said, adding that Hubei’s health officials  had dismissed the rumor as untrue, since the province had yet to report human cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus. In the post, Xinhua cited Zhou as saying, “A doctor from Yichang People’s Hospital died of H7N9 at 4:21 a.m. yesterday.”  The doctor was a pregnant woman aged 31, he added, and included a dramatic touch. “A baby is still in the mother’s belly and doctors who participated in the emergency treatment have been quarantined,” he said. “Multiple cases of human H7N9 infection were also found in other regions in the province.”  China has reported more than 120 human H7N9 cases this year, including at least 31 deaths. The government initially tried to conceal an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about one in 10 of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. China kicked off a tough campaign to control online discussion last year, threatening legal action against people whose perceived rumours were widely reposted. Authorities said the move was needed to preserve social stability and halt the spread of untrue stories that could cause panic. Rights groups and dissidents criticized the crackdown as another tool for the ruling Communist Party to limit criticism of itself and further rein in freedom of expression."," ",true,Health News
34583,Coffee serves as an effective mosquito repellant and protection against infection by the Zika virus.,"August 9, 2016",What's true: A small bit of research has indicated that coffee can be lethal to mosquito larvae if applied to them in a specific manner. What's false: Research has not shown than coffee is effective at repelling mosquitoes and preventing people from getting bitten by them.,Kim LaCapria,"In August 2016 concerns about the spread of the Zika virus escalated as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a warning about active Zika transmission in northern Miami. Zika exposure has been cited in the death of one Texas baby and the birth of several others afflicted with microcephaly in the United States in 2016. Meanwhile, the Miami New Times published an article suggesting that residents could use “good old café cubano” to repel mosquitoes responsible for spreading the disease: So how do we protect ourselves from the Zika threat? The Department of Health recommends wearing insect repellent and covering your limbs. Also make sure there’s no standing water anywhere on your property. The smallest amount of water can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and hold thousands of larvae. There’s one other way to ward off the pests: Use good ol’ café cubano. In the video above, Abuela Mami, a local company that ships care packages of Cuban treats to your door, shows you how to combat mosquitoes by using coffee grounds. In case you’re wondering if there’s any science to back up this claim, turns out there is. According to a study conducted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, female mosquitoes laid fewer eggs on areas covered with coffee grounds. Also, “egg hatching success was extremely low among eggs that matured on substrates soaked with coffee extracts.” Abuela Mami, the Cuban goods importer named in the article, shared a video that instructed viewers to sprinkle coffee grounds around their yards. However, the framing of the video led many to infer that coffee grounds or other coffee extracts were meant to be applied directly to their skin in order to repel mosquitoes:  Given that coffee is present in some skin care products, it isn’t likely there’s much danger in applying coffee grounds to skin (save for staining clothing or smelling like a Starbucks). But neither does there seem to be much evidence suggesting coffee has much effect (if any) on mosquito-human interaction, particularly when applied topically. A May 2015 article by The Germ Code author Jason Tetro described some of the science behind the notion that coffee can be used against mosquitoes, but primarily in the sense of its being a larvae control measure and not a topical repellant: [C]offee has shown promise in the past. Back in 2003, it was shown to kill off the babies — larvae — of a cousin of albopictus, Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito. Although the mechanism wasn’t entirely figured out, the authors at the time believed some of the chemicals in the black stuff blocked some of the important stages of development. They could not develop into adults. A closer inspection revealed some of the molecules mimicked those of insecticides. But the effect was far more dramatic and the insects could not develop resistance. In 2012, the effects on Ae. aegypti were shown to be the same in Ae. Albopictus. In this case, the larvae were exposed to coffee extracts. Once again, the larvae were unable to develop and the population was killed off. It meant coffee could be used to keep both mosquito populations from getting out of hand. Those findings pertained not to the matter of larger concern (i.e., keeping mature mosquitoes from biting people and infecting them with Zika), but to preventing larval mosquitoes from maturing in the first place. The information stemmed from research published by Parasites & Vectors in 2015 that examined addressing issues of coffee disposal alongside mosquito control measures. Researchers observed effects of coffee on the breeding (not the biting) of mosquitoes: The [study’s] results indicated that the presence of coffee extracts in artificial containers as breeding sites prevent females from laying substantial numbers of eggs. In addition, the presence of only oviposition sites with [coffee extracts] induced many females to retain most of their mature eggs within ovaries. In particular, this study indicated that there is a deleterious impact on the embryonic development of Ae. albopictus; eggs that matured in either [coffee extracts] or [diluted coffee extracts] environments were less viable than their counterparts that were maintained in a water-moistened environment. Finally, this study showed that females that developed successfully as larvae in a coffee environment tended to heavily oviposit in container habitats holding coffee. These results illustrate the potential of coffee extracts to assist in dengue vector control, acting both as an uninviting signal to gravid Ae. albopictus females and as a barrier to embryogenesis. These attributes suggest that coffee and its waste may be useful in developing potent, low-cost, and bio-rational mosquito control strategies. More importantly, turning coffee waste into an alternate control tool against mosquito vectors may represent a viable solution to the coffee-related pollution problem. Unrelated research in 2005 [PDF] similarly observed coffee (and perhaps caffeine) as having an adverse effect on mosquito larvae but did not delve into application of coffee to the skin to ward off mosquito bites. Moreover, those findings reported that coffee could also serve as a possible source of nutrition for mosquito larvae: However, the survivorship of larvae for UCG 0.01 and UCG 0.05 in comparison to the controls suggested that in nutrient-poor systems, UCG in low concentrations could benefit the larvae and boost their survivorship and hence, increase the number of larvae that successfully hatch into adults. Small amounts of UCG could enhance bacterial and algal growth, thus providing food for mosquito larvae. In short, some evidence suggests that coffee might inhibit mosquito breeding (but also suggests that in some cases could facilitate mosquito larvae survival). The science behind coffee grounds’ inhibiting mosquito life cycles is thin, and no solid scientific evidence indicates that topical application of coffee will repel Zika-carrying mosquitos."," ",unproven,"Medical, coffee, Home Cures, home remedies"
21813,Voted the ‘best specialty plate in America’,"July 3, 2011",Rhode Island lighthouse group says its fundraising license plate was voted best specialty plate in U.S.,Richard Salit,"Specialty license plates are all the rage. In some states, you can choose from as many as 200 kinds. Rhode Island is no exception. You can pick from five specialty plates, with more on the way, not counting traditional ones for firefighters and the military. They’ve become so prominent that one -- promoting Plum Beach Lighthouse -- appears on a billboard on a stretch of Route 95 traveled by 100,000 motorists a day. ""Voted the ‘best specialty plate in American,’ "" the billboard reads. Now that’s license to brag! But is it true? We looked to our own navigational beacon, the Truth-O-Meter, to guide us. Our voyage first took us to the billboard near the Providence-Pawtucket line, best visible to southbound motorists. It shows the license plate, with its idyllic image of the Plum Beach Lighthouse surrounded by placid blue waters and two sport fishermen in a boat. ""Get yours now!"" reads the billboard, directing people to a Web site. ""Thousands sold!"" The license plate is a fundraising tool for Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse, which acquired the 1897 lighthouse 22 years ago with the goal of preserving it. The spark-plug style lighthouse, off North Kingstown in Narragansett Bay’s West Passage, was abandoned following construction of the Jamestown Bridge in 1941. Seeking to raise funds to paint the lighthouse, the organization got General Assembly approval in late 2009 for a license plate commemorating the landmark. Since then, the group has sold nearly 4,300 plates, the most of any specialty plate in Rhode Island, president David Zapatka told us. Specialty plates cost $41.50, with $20 going toward the sponsoring group. So far, $86,000 has been raised for the lighthouse, some of which was used to paint the landmark and install solar-powered lighting, Zapatka said. Following the debut of the lighthouse tag, a local license plate lover nominated it for a competition held by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA). Every year, its 3,000 members nominate license plates -- only new ones, by the way -- and then vote on the best. ALPCA announced that its members selected from 12 finalists from 2010. Half were so-called ""general issue"" plates, the kind that states redesign every few years and which most motorists get when they register their vehicles. The other half were specialty plates. New Mexico’s bright turquoise and gold plate took first. Plum Beach Lighthouse got second. While it was honored as the runner-up, it received no accolades for ""best"" anything. So we asked Zapatka to shine some light on the billboard’s claim. ""I figured we might get called on that,"" he said immediately. ""Rather than put up on the billboard, ‘We are the second best plate in America,’ we changed the wording to say we are the ‘best specialty plate in America.’ Did they officially come out and say, ‘You are the best specialty in America’? No."" But, he insisted, Plum Beach Lighthouse beat out the other five specialty plates, not to mention all but one of the other plates. ""Is it a stretch? Yes,"" he acknowledged. But, he said, ""there is no other specialty plate that finished higher than us in the competition. … It’s a marketing scheme."" What does ALPCA think about how the Rhode Island group is tooting its horn? Contest coordinator Gus Oliver, who didn’t vote since he was running the contest, called it a ""misnomer"" and said Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse ""may be stretching"" the contest results in making its claim. A few years ago, there was a separate category for specialty plates, he said, but not anymore. ""The most accurate statement is that, of the specialty plates, it scored the highest or the best,"" said Oliver, who’s from Tulsa, Okla. But Oliver didn’t take issue with the billboard. ""They put a positive spin on it,"" he said, adding, ""if there had been separate voting [for the two kinds of plates], I feel certain it would have represented the outcome."" Zapatka, who works in media and is quite familiar with PolitiFact, asked, ""Are you going to light our pants on fire?"" Hmmm, we can see it now: a Plum Beach Lighthouse plate that reads PANTS-AFIRE. Nah. You just can’t go around tossing matches at non profit groups that are trying to raise money for causes as cherished as lighthouses. Besides, the license plate got more votes than any other specialty tag. Still, the lighthouse group knew it was making a claim that wasn’t quite accurate. That’s why we’re stamping their plate BRLY-TRU. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

3260,WVa Senate forms committee dedicated to child welfare issues.,,A committee has been formed in the West Virginia Senate to focus on upcoming legislation related to child welfare.," John Ra","The Senate Select Committee on Children and Families, whose formation was announced Wednesday, will be led by Kanawha County Republican and Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo. The committee will focus on issues related to the state’s ongoing foster care crisis and substance abuse epidemic, the Senate said in a news release. The state’s foster ranks have swelled to about 7,000 children as the state grapples with the opioid crisis. West Virginia leads the nation by far in the rate of drug overdose deaths. The statement cited a recent legislative audit that found the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Child Protective Services did not meet a required time frame for investigating child abuse and neglect allegations in 50% of cases in fiscal year 2018. In addition, Child Protective Services continues to experience high turnover, while the drug epidemic has increased CPS worker caseloads by 79% since 2015. The committee was formed because legislation on child welfare issues otherwise would have had to compete with dozens of other bills if they had been channeled through other committees. “Our children are our state’s most precious resource, and it’s clear that despite our best efforts, we are falling way short in adequately providing for the needs of the ones who need us the most,” Senate President Carmichael said. “My hope with this new Select Committee is that the members take a deep dive on these issues and work toward the kinds of solutions that will ensure no child in the state of West Virginia gets lost in a bureaucracy that does not put them on the best path to stability, comfort, and self-worth.” The GOP-controlled legislature began its regular session Wednesday. Takubo and fellow committee member Ron Stollings, D-Boone, are physicians. The nine-member committee also includes Senate education chairwoman Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, and Democrat Paul Hardesty, a former board of education chairman in Logan County. “It brings everything to the forefront,” Takubo said in an interview before the Senate convened Wednesday. “Politics will kind of divide Senate members or House members, but the one thing we’ve always been (in the) loop on is families and children. We’re trying to bring in the resources of the Senate members to look at this as a whole.” The state also faces a federal class-action lawsuit alleging the foster care system has failed to protect children. The state is seeking to dismiss the suit, brought by nonprofit advocacy groups and a law firm on behalf of a dozen children. Department of Health and Human Resources Secretary Bill Crouch continues to make substantive changes to its system. The lawsuit describes stories of alleged neglect and harm done to foster children in DHHR’s care. Marcia Lowry, executive director of the nonprofit A Better Childhood, has said the state isn’t doing enough to deal with problems in its foster system."," ",true,"Opioids, Foster care, General News, Legislation, Child welfare, Health, West Virginia, Child abuse, Charleston, Epidemics"

31225,Women absorb and retain DNA from every man they have had sex with.,"June 26, 2017","We are also unsure, for the record, what motivation would exist for scientists to hide the truth about male microchimerism in the first place.",Alex Kasprak,"On 23 June 2017, frequent purveyor of misinformation YourNewsWire.com posted an article (“Women Absorb and Retain DNA from Every Man They Have Sex With”) that made the claim that “a new study” demonstrates that cells transferred from a man to a woman during intercourse become integrated into that woman’s body after sex. Every single time. In actuality, however, that study (which was published in PLOS ONE in 2012, despite being billed as “new” in 2017) demonstrated for the first time the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women (who had been examined in autopsy). The existence of male cells in the bodies of females, in general, is not news. As discussed in a PLOS ONE blog post describing that 2012 study, their presence is typically ascribed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy: The idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn’t new. It’s called microchimerism. […] Medical chimerism arises after a transfusion or transplant, and it may follow pregnancy. Our microbiomes, the bacteria within us, are more like guests than body parts. [The research groups responsible for the 2012 study] found Y chromosome DNA sequences in several brain regions in autopsy slides from 37 out of 59 women. Such DNA liberated from fetal cells can come from several sources: children, fetuses that never made it to be born, older siblings, or twins. Both son and daughter DNA partake in this “feto-maternal trafficking,” but female DNA, at the chromosomal level, is harder to detect amid the maternal two X’s. The significance, in the case of that specific research paper, was that it demonstrated that these male cells — wherever they came from — were able to cross what is known as the blood-brain barrier — a semi-permeable membrane that prevents most chemicals in the blood from entering the brain. The linked study, in fact, does not once mention sexual intercourse as a proposed mechanism. This is as close as you will get from the PLOS ONE paper: The most likely source of male [microchimerism, Mc] in female brain is acquisition of fetal Mc from pregnancy with a male fetus. In women without sons, male DNA can also be acquired from an abortion or a miscarriage. The pregnancy history was unknown for all but a few subjects in the current studies, thus male Mc in female brain could not be evaluated according to specific prior pregnancy history. In addition to prior pregnancies, male Mc could be acquired by a female from a recognized or vanished male twin, an older male sibling, or through non-irradiated blood transfusion. At least that’s what they want you to think, according to YourNewsWire: Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial. Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain. At this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from. In an odd chronologic twist that necessitates abandoning the notion that time progresses linearly in one direction, YourNewsWire then used text from a paper published in 2005 to support the argument that scientists buried this salacious truth, discovered in 2012, in other “sub studies”. That 2005 paper, which does indeed show the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males (or, in some cases, at all), makes only passing reference to the possibility that sexual intercourse alone could contribute male microchirality to women, noting that the issue has yet to be studied: Another possibility that has not been investigated is whether male DNA can be detected in a woman’s circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy. That explanation is the authors’ speculative fourth suggestion (out of four) after three more plausible, and actually researched, theories: One potential explanation for male microchimerism could be a nonrecognized (male) miscarriage. […] A second potential source is from a “vanished (male) twin.” A vanished twin is thought to be a relatively common phenomena resulting from spontaneous resorption of one sac or embryo in a twin pregnancy. […] A third possibility is from an older male sibling transferred by the maternal circulation to the fetus of a later pregnancy. [i.e. you are born with male DNA your older brother left behind in your mother’s body]. A paper published, fittingly, in the journal Chimerism in 2015 investigated this topic further, concluding that — potentially — all of those potential mechanisms may contribute. That paper, which was fairly limited in its dataset, makes it clear that the sexual intercourse transfer of male chimerism remains entirely speculative: A total of 154 girls were studied of which 21 (13.6%) tested positive for male microchimerism. There was a tendency that girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism if their mothers previously had received transfusion, had given birth to a son or had had a spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, the oldest girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism. However, less than half of microchimerism positivity was attributable to these factors. In conclusion, data suggest that male microchimerism in young girls may originate from an older brother either full born or from a discontinued pregnancy or from transfusion during pregnancy. We speculate that sexual intercourse may be important but other sources of male cells likely exist in young girls. Far from demonstrating that 100 percent of a woman’s male sexual partners have male cells that de facto become part of their body, the studies cobbled together by YourNewsWire show that even if sexual intercourse transferred cells from a male that later became incorporated into the female partner’s body (which science has only speculated about at this point), it clearly wouldn’t happen in all cases."," ",false,"Medical, dna, newspunch.com, sex"
30819,"Canada has legalized euthanasia, enabling parents to ""kill disabled children.","November 27, 2017","On 22 November 2017, YourNewsWire.com reported that “Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law.” The “controversial new law” passed in June 2016, not November 2017. Further, that law specifically prohibits even “mature minors” (much less parents) the ability to choose medically assisted death, and it is not by even the most creative interpretation a free pass to euthanize children.",Kim LaCapria,"On 22 November 2017, the web sites Neon Nettle and YourNewsWire.com (among others) published reports about euthanasia and pediatric patients in Canada, claiming that “a controversial new law” now allows parents to end the lives of children with disabilities: The legislation extends existing ‘assisted suicide’ laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now, in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life. The new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents. Liftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that “killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering.” “Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding,” he wrote in the National Review. “I guess Robert Latimer–a Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsy–was a visionary,” he added. Neither site referenced any news reports to support the claims, linking instead to a 26 October 2017 National Review Online speculative editorial: “Canada Child Euthanasia: A Matter of Time?” That opinion piece speculated that legal euthanasia in Canada could eventually be available to minors: Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding. The law is still brand new, and yet there is already talk about allowing dementia patients to be killed and a mentally ill patient was euthanized with the permission of a court. And now, children are in the target range. From the CBC story: The Canadian Paediatric Society says its members are “increasingly” being asked by parents about the option of seeking medically assisted death for children, while a survey of doctors found nearly half of the respondents supported assisted death for kids with “progressive terminal illness or intractable pain.” The linked article examines the provisions of euthanasia-related legislation passed in June 2016 (Bill C-14). Among them is a years-long review of youth access to medically assisted dying: “Medical assistance in dying is something that has been legislated [for adults] and stated [as] needing to be accessible … but there isn’t the same ‘oomph’ for saying that all Canadians need good access to palliative care,” said Dr. Dawn Davies, chair of the society’s bioethics committee and a pediatric palliative care physician in Edmonton, in an interview with CBC News. “Where the issue of medical assistance in dying is ever raised by a child, you know, we would advocate that that should automatically be a referral for pediatric palliative care.” When Bill C-14, the law governing medically assisted dying for adults, was passed in June 2016, it included a requirement that the ministers of justice and health initiate an independent review on whether “mature minors” — youth under age 18 but deemed capable of giving consent — should be eligible for medically assisted death. That review is expected to be presented to Parliament by December 2018. According to the report, ongoing research includes feedback from pediatricians about discussions with the parents of “critically ill” minors: In addition to the “mature minors” question, the surveys also found that parents are asking pediatricians about assisted death on behalf of their critically ill children. Out of the 1,050 pediatricians who responded, 118 said they had exploratory discussions about assisted death with the parents of sick children, involving 419 kids in all. Forty-five respondents said they had received explicit requests for assisted death from parents, involving a total of 91 children. More than half of the requests involved a child under a year old. There needs to be “a recognition that parents are making this request not as a self-serving thing,” Davies told The Canadian Press. “[Those] children have illnesses where there is really profound suffering.” Canada’s Department of Justice’s “Questions and Answers” page (archived) about the June 2016 law addresses “mature minors,” but not parents: At this time, not enough is known about the risks and benefits of medical assistance in dying for minors. The trial judge in [a related ruling] found that, to the degree that there was a societal consensus on eligibility for medical assistance in dying, it was limited to mentally competent or capable adults…. However, the Government would also initiate an independent review of the special considerations related to requests for medical assistance in dying by mature minors within 180 days of the legislation receiving Royal Assent."," ",false,"Junk News, canada, disabled, euthanasia"
10075,Children in intensive care recover faster with little to no nutrition,"March 24, 2016","This brief news release, issued by a university hospital system in Belgium, is loosely based on published results of a multinational, randomized clinical study designed to test the value of adding early intravenous macronutrient feedings to the nutritional care of critically ill children in intensive care units who are unable to eat or be fed normally. Such so-called “total” parenteral nutrition, delivered via the bloodstream, is commonplace in pediatric ICUs, researchers say, because of concerns that “macronutrient deficits” will lead to increased infections, weakness, and longer stays on ventilators and in ICUs overall. The problem, however, has been the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence for this assumption in children, and — significantly — growing evidence in studies of adults that the practice actually delays healing and increases infections. The study on which the release is based does indeed add strong clinical evidence that the same is true for children, and that delaying for a week or so the use of full parenteral feedings is clearly associated with lower rates of infections and earlier discharge from the ICUs. But this release could leave some readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness. Here’s why: contrary to the language in the release, the study did not “prove” the idea that “receiving little or no nutrition” in the first week of an ICU stay “makes children recover faster.” Nor were these children “fasting,” in the conventional sense. In fact, all of the children received micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), blood sugar controls, and “enteral” nutrition in which some nutrients are delivered through a tube from the nose to the stomach. The release further misleadingly implies that “nutritional deficiency” somehow directly leads to faster and better recoveries for seriously ill children; in fact, the authors of the published study report that the reason for the benefit of delaying total parenteral nutrition remains “speculative,” but possibly due to complex effects of digestion and metabolism that have an impact on the immune system. Although numbers are hard to come by (and the release makes no effort to find any) an estimated quarter million infants and children a year are admitted to intensive care units with critical illnesses and injuries. Scientists know that  the nutritional needs of children’s rapidly growing brains and bodies make their care trickier in some respects than adult care, and the use of intravenous feedings of a complete package of calories and specific nutrients are commonly started within 24 hours of an ICU stay. But few studies have been done to test the value of such feedings, usually given as supplements or sometimes in place of enteral feedings of some nutrients through a nasogastric tube. And studies in adults have strongly suggested that parenteral feedings are associated with higher rates of infection and longer ICU stays. This study matters because treatment of children in the ICU is not uncommon and the outcomes of interest (time in the ICU, complication rates, death) are important to everyone.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","We rated this Not Applicable since giving parenteral (IV) nutrition seems to be done routinely and this study reviewed withholding it (which should save money). The biggest cost saver might be fewer days in the ICU. Some discussion of the cost-benefit analysis of changing the protocol might have been helpful to readers. The release quotes the lead coordinating investigator saying “the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery,” but it offers not a single data point. There is no information provided other than the number of total participants, and no mention of the makeup of the randomized groups, the specific findings, or the comparative rates of new infections and lengths of ICU stay (the two endpoints of the study overall). The release does note more correctly at one point that the study was designed to “challenge the validity” of early parenteral feeding, but it never explains the details or context of those feedings. The absolute difference in the outcomes between groups is left unanswered. The study report goes into substantial background detail about potential harms of malnutrition and overfeeding, and the release — although without specific data — more or less describes the concerns. The release could have been strengthened even more if it had informed readers about the rigorous informed consent obtained from parents, and the efforts to maintain basic nutrient levels in all the children. The release did not include enough details about the design for most readers to make sense of the study. There’s almost no information about the makeup of the protocol feedings, the use of insulin, micronutrients, saline and glucose solutions, or the limitations of the study duly noted by the researchers in their report. Importantly, it’s not made clear that these children were being provided nutrition through a feeding tube in their stomachs. The release doesn’t give us any sense of how many children may be assigned to the ICU, or how many might benefit from a change in nutrition protocol. So while it doesn’t disease-monger, we’re hesitant to give the release credit here. We’ll call it Not Applicable. There’s no information in the release about funding or potential conflicts of interest. This release is about a comparative study between early and late parenteral feeding upon admittance to an ICU. Parenteral feedings are a part of standard care and that is understood. The release states that a new nutrition protocol has disproven a theory about standard care. That’s novel.

17161,Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet.,"April 9, 2014","Taylor said that ""drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."" There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now.",Dave Umhoefer,"On April 1, 2014 state Rep. Chris Taylor warned the citizenry about eyes in the sky and attacks on privacy. ""Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet,"" the Madison Democrat wrote in a news release. Was Taylor pulling the public’s leg on April Fools’ Day? No, she was dead serious. Taylor spoke the day the state Senate approved and sent to Gov. Scott Walker a bipartisan bill -- cosponsored by Taylor -- to put limits on drone use. The Wisconsin bill, similar to others around the country, attempts to prohibit both law enforcement agencies and private individuals from recording people in locations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Example: inside their homes. Under the legislation, it would be unlawful in a criminal investigation for police -- without first getting a search warrant -- to use drones equipped with video or audio recording equipment to collect evidence in such locations. Emergency exceptions to this prohibition include locating an escaped prisoner, aiding in a search and rescue mission, executing an arrest warrant or preventing imminent harm to a person or the imminent destruction of evidence. The bill allows hobbyists, entrepreneurs or aerial photographers to use drones as long as that use does not intentionally violate an individual’s privacy interests. Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law on April 8, 2014. Taylor, in her statement, focuses on the state of the technology, not on who is doing the recording. Let’s see if she’s correct. Some basics first. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small aircraft that can fly by remote control without an onboard human operator. They can be part of a system that includes a digital network and personnel on the ground, and can be equipped with high-powered cameras, with infrared devices that sense objects through walls, and with laser radar that can see through trees and foliage, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2013 report. Their use by law enforcement and the military in the U.S. ""raises far-reaching issues concerning the extent of government surveillance authority, the value of privacy in the digital age, and the role of Congress in reconciling these issues,"" the report noted. To address Taylor’s specific statement, we turned to government studies, technology and privacy experts, law enforcement officials and drone manufacturers. The bottom line: A wide range of experts said Taylor’s scenario reflects the capability of current technology. Size Drones can be as small as insects and as large as regular aircraft. Models used by law enforcement have included the Draganflyer X4-ES, which is just 24 inches wide, and the AeroVironment Wasp, described as ""bird-size"" in a Washington Post story about Texas police conducting discreet video surveillance before a SWAT team stormed a property that officials believed had a cache of weapons. A tiny drone developed for the U.S. military weighs less than a AA battery and resembles a live hummingbird that can hover, climb, fly through an open doorway and relay real-time video back to its operator, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That drone, AeroVironment’s Nano Hummingbird, could someday provide new reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in urban environments, the AeroVironment website says. Someday, because it’s not in production yet. Army-technology.com said in 2012 that UAVs ""are getting smaller and more agile to enable combatants to gather intelligence from hard to reach areas, such as in buildings and through tunnels."" Internet A Draganflyer official told us it’s easy to upload the live video images that a remote operator is viewing. It just takes some additional equipment. ""That’s a minor thing as far as I’m concerned,"" said Kevin Lauscher, a former police officer who is now sales manager and flight trainer at Draganfly Innovations. ""The realistic expectation of privacy is pretty weak in these days of technology"" and people recording conversations and posting photos with their phones, he said. Recording people in their homes Taylor aide Craig Trost told us the representative meant recording through a window, not with see-through-walls camera technology that is still under development. Taking pictures of people inside their home is possible with a drone, various law enforcement officials told us. Image quality would be a major challenge though. Daniel Schwarzbach, a pilot for the Houston Police and executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, said police could film people through their windows after getting a search warrant but he doesn’t recall that happening or police being interested in it. So, Taylor’s description of drone capabilities is not imaginary. How likely it is to happen? That’s an important question, and we got an earful on it, though we don’t think the answer bears directly on the accuracy of her warning about what is possible with current technology. ""Doing what she is afraid of would be difficult at best, it would be illegal under peeping Tom laws, and it’s not on the agenda of law enforcement,"" said Gregory McNeal,  a national security and criminal law expert at Pepperdine University law school. McNeal added: ""If she is worried about invasions of privacy, she should update Wisconsin’s invasion of privacy laws for all forms of observation, not just drones because what she’s alleging can be done by a drone can be done with an iPhone, any camera, or binoculars."" The privacy issue is not about unmanned aircraft, it is about image capture and retention, in the view of  Alan Frazier, a University of North Dakota aviation professor and former Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputy. ""Agencies need to have  a robust policy in place regarding appropriate uses of all types of image capture devices,"" he said. Taylor, a lawyer, says it’s not at all clear that current law criminalizes peeping remotely using a drone. Law enforcement officials using drones told us a rogue user might try to do that, but not them. ""We cannot look into homes, our systems are twice the size of a goose and we don't operate in areas where we have internet,  nor do we have, or need, the desire to upload anything to the internet …"" said Ben Miller, director of the Mesa County, Colorado, unmanned aircraft systems program. ""We mostly take aerial pictures of crime scenes and conduct aerial search and rescue flights."" Taylor, for the record, says she wasn’t suggesting that law enforcement was illegally peeking into windows, just the possible uses of the technology. Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said a hobbyist could buy a drone size of a large bird and put a camera on it and get video and put it on the Internet. But Bohm called that a ""side issue"" because there’s no evidence drones are being widely employed in that fashion, in part due to Federal Aviation Administration rules, Bohm said. Public entities seeking to fly drones must get FAA approval. More than 1,800 have done so since 2007, including law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions, the FAA says. (The Milwaukee Police Department does not own or use drones, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us.) Under current FAA rules, a drone must be flown within the line of sight of the operator, less than 400 feet above the ground, during daylight conditions, inside uncontrolled airspace and more than five miles from any airport or other location with aviation activities. ""Flying model aircraft solely for hobby or recreational reasons does not require FAA approval, but hobbyists must operate according to the agency's model aircraft guidance,"" FAA spokesman Les Dorr said in a statement. Commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis and to date, only one has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle. A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. That authorization was limited to the Arctic. Our rating Taylor said that ""drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."" There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now.

29319,"A photograph shows people lining up outside a Houston, Texas shelter to turn in unwanted animals to be euthanized.","June 29, 2017","What's true: It's statistically likely that around three quarters of those photographed with animals were turning in stray or unwanted animals. What's false: The vast majority of animals turned in to this particular shelter are not put down. Statistically, only around 14% of animals in the photograph were likely to end up being euthanized.",Dan MacGuill,"On 27 June 2017, the Facebook page of the “Special Needs Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation” organization (also called SNARR) posted a photo of people with animals lining up outside a Houston, Texas animal shelter, purportedly to surrender the pets and have them put down:  This is the line at the Houston, Texas city shelter today to surrender animals. These dogs and cats are about to be DUMPED to face a death sentence. SNARR’s Facebook post was subsequently picked up by One Green Planet web site, whose article about the topic was headlined: “[What the Hell]!? People are Literally Lining Up to Dump Their Pets Before July 4th Weekend.” The Pet Rescue Report got in on the action as well, writing: “Heartbreaking Reality: Owners Line Up at Shelter to Surrender Their Pets Before July 4th Parties.” The Facebook post was removed on 1 July 2017, but had been widely shared, and some commenters began to question the sourcing and veracity of the claim that the owners shown in the photo were all in line to surrender their dogs. Many suggested that the demeanor of some of those in line was not indicative of giving up their dogs, and speculated that it was more likely to be a line for wellness checkups. Beforing removing it, SNARR had edited its original post, specifying that the two men shown in the immediate foreground of the photo left the line in order to have a wellness check-up for their pet, but still suggesting that all the others (around a dozen in the photo) were there to surrender theirs. We tracked down one of those men, Juan Martinez of Houston, Texas, whose identity we were able to verify. Martinez told us that he and his brother-in-law (also pictured), had visited the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care (BARC) animal shelter on Carr Street in Houston on the afternoon of 27 June 2017. We were able to find documents showing that Martinez was there to have his mother’s newly-fostered kitten spayed and given deworming treatment. Contrary to what the group claimed on Facebook, Martinez said everyone waited in the same line, regardless of the purpose of their visit. Although he did not speak to anyone else in line, apart from his brother-in-law, he told us there was a positive atmosphere in the line, and that it was his impression that “nobody was there to drop [their pets] off.” A SNARR spokesperson told us that the organization’s treasurer took the photo at around noon on 27 June 2017. The group’s treasurer was there to help a friend look for a lost dog. The viral Facebook post was written by SNARR’s president, Lauren Connolly. Soon after the picture in question was taken, the shelter staff came out to ask people the reasoning for their visits (in order to bring in the wellness clinic visitors). The only people who stepped out were the two gentlemen with the cardboard carrier at the back of the line and the member of Snarr’s board, which [sic] were then brought to a different entrance. The rest were surrenders – whether it was owner surrenders or stray surrenders (stray being once someone’s pet – either that had been lost or that has been abandoned), we do not know. We asked SNARR how its treasurer found out that all the remaining visitors to the shelter were there to surrender pets. The group’s spokesperson said: Our treasurer did not affirm with each person if they were there to surrender. Conversations overheard in line and with the shelter staff that [sic] led the wellness clinic visitors out of the line and to a different entrance implied that. After publication of this article, SNARR’s treasurer contacted us to make clear that they had not taken the photo with the intention of it being published or used in the way it was. As of 1 July 2017, the treasurer had left SNARR, in response to the episode. A spokesperson for the Houston shelter explained the queuing system in place at the center. Their explanation contradicts some of the claims made by SNARR. According to BARC, everyone visiting the shelter stays in one line until they come through the front door. At that point they are asked the purpose of their visit, and triaged into three or four separate lines (one for the wellness clinic, one for the foster clinic, one or two to turn in stray or unwanted dogs.) This means that, in theory at least, any given group of people waiting outside the shelter would be there for a variety of reasons. The spokesperson told us that on 27 June 2017, the center offered the following services: adoptions, intake (stray and unwanted animals), a pet wellness clinic, foster clinic, and spay/neuter clinic. On that day, the shelter saw: 23 adoptions, 33 transfer/rescues (animals given to local rescue partners, who later adopt them out to the public), three lost dogs returned to their owners, seven dogs fostered out. 102 animals were turned in as strays, 52 dogs were surrendered by their owners, and 57 people visited the foster or wellness clinic with pets. Of the 211 cases where people brought animals to the shelter that day, 27% were visiting the foster or wellness clinic, and 73% were turning in dogs — either strangers presenting lost or stray dogs, or owners surrendering their pets. So it is statistically likely that about three-quarters of any given group waiting in line with animals outside the shelter that day, were turning in stray or unwanted dogs. So does this mean that all, or even most, of these dogs will be euthanized? No. SNARR’s Facebook post describes, in very emotive, even disturbing terms, the fate that supposedly awaits the animals seen in the photo: They’ll be dragged from the person they love, the person that swore to love and care for them for the duration of their lives. They’ll be confused, sad, but most of all terrified. The smell of death is overpowering here. After a day or two of sleeping on cold, dirty floors with the cacophony always all around, shivering and scared, they’ll be walked down a long hall to a room. A needle will slide into their veins and they’ll slip away, wondering where their beloved human is and why they never came back. All the while, their human is probably kicking back at the beach for the 4th of July weekend. Only 52 out of 211 animals (25 percent) brought to the shelter that day were brought by their owners, to be surrendered. Almost twice as many (102) were strays or lost dogs being brought to the shelter. And finally, more than 80 percent of dogs turned in to the BARC shelter — for whatever reason — are not put down. The shelter’s spokesperson provided us statistics showing that in 2016, 80.4 percent of animals turned in (either as strays, lost dogs, or by their owners), were successfully adopted out, returned to their owners or otherwise kept alive. (There is a sliver of irony in this episode. Juan Martinez, who was in the photo that accompanied Snarr’s inflammatory Facebook post, was bringing a fostered kitten to BARC for medical care. That kitten was once a stray, and could well have been turned in to the shelter by someone who once waited in line outside, just like those in the photo.) The percentage of dogs euthanized was 19.6 percent. Since the total number of dogs turned in on 27 June 2017 was 154, we can estimate that about 30 (19.6 percent) of these will end up being euthanized. And since the total number of animals brought to the center (including the medical and foster clinic) was 211 — this means only around 14 percent will end up being put down. In other words, the statistical likelihood is this: Of the animals waiting outside the BARC clinic at any given moment on 27 June 2017 — the day this viral photo was taken — the vast majority (around 86 percent) were likely not to end up being euthanized.","http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/ataglance/At%20A%20Glance%20Calendar16.pdf, http://archive.is/jvpfN, http://archive.is/o1rnC, http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/",false,"Viral Phenomena, animal shelters, animals, cats"
33541,Hillary Clinton supported and helped free two Black Panthers accused of torturing and murdering Alex Rackley.,"June 30, 1999",Did Hillary Clinton support and help free two Black Panthers accused of murder?,David Mikkelson,"It’s difficult for those who weren’t around to experience the 1960s first-hand to fully understand the controversy that swirled around radical parties such as the Black Panthers. Certainly many Americans viewed them as representing the very worst of that era’s political movements: a group of hate-filled militant thugs who felt their disaffection with the existing social and political systems justified anything required to achieve their aim of “revolution by any means necessary” (such as smuggling guns into a Marin County courtroom in an attempt to free Panther George Jackson, resulting in a shoot-out that killed a judge, two inmates, and Jackson’s brother). Others at the time, however, believed the Panthers were the only political group that truly represented a downtrodden and marginalized group of people who had been enslaved, discriminated against, and denied civil rights protections for hundreds of years; that sought to improve the condition of the poor by operating schools, opening medical clinics, and providing free breakfasts for ghetto children; and that had the courage to stand up to the brutality visited upon them by law enforcement acting in the service of a government and a society that sought to “keep them in their place.” In May of 1969, Black Panther founder and national chairman Bobby Seale (who had already been indicted for his alleged participation in demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968) made a trip from Oakland to New Haven, Connecticut, to speak at Yale University. The Black Panthers were by then nationally known, a focus of media attention, and under the active surveillance of the FBI. (J. Edgar Hoover had publicly declared several months earlier that he considered the Panthers “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.”) Rumors of police informants and government spies having infiltrated the party were rampant, and a man named Alex Rackley, a member of the Panthers’ New York chapter, fell under suspicion. Rackley was taken to the home of Warren Kimbro (described as a “community organizer and aspiring Panther”) where he was held captive for 24 hours, beaten, and scalded with boiling water in an effort to force him to confess. Rackley was then taken to a marsh in Middlefield by Kimbro, George Sams (a Panther field marshal and, according to some, himself a police informant), and Lonnie McLucas (a Panther member from Bridgeport), where Sams ordered Kimbro and McLucas to kill the suspected informant. (Who did the actual killing has always been disputed: McLucas reportedly fired the first shot, but Kimbro admitted to delivering the bullet to the head that killed Rackley.) Rackley’s body was discovered the next day by fishermen, and fourteen Black Panthers were arrested and charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and nine of them were indicted. The subsequent murder trials of Black Panthers that took place in New Haven beginning in 1970 was a cause célèbre, the latest “trial of the century” that pitted the “establishment” against the “radicals”: the former supposedly valiantly defending the values of mainstream American society, while the latter were supposedly being framed and railroaded by government powers determined to destroy them at any cost. Upwards of 12,000 Black Panther supporters made their way to New Haven, and many of them were housed and fed in and around the campus of Yale University. Classes at Yale were made optional for the last few months of the term as Panther supporters swarmed the campus in protest and the president of Yale University, Kingman Brewster Jr., announced: “I personally want to say that I’m appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S.” From that maelstrom came the 1999 political piece reproduced above, which claims that two 1990’s political figures, Hillary Clinton (then First Lady) and Bill Lann Lee (former acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division whose appointment by President Bill Clinton was controversial because of Lee’s support for affirmative action programs),  defended the Black Panthers, helped “shut down” Yale University, and aided the accused Panthers in going free or serving lenient sentences. But all of that is gross exaggeration: neither Clinton nor Lee did any of those things, and any involvement they had with the New Haven Black Panther trials was extremely minor and tangential. We’ll begin with the last part, the claim that “These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial.”  This statement is ridiculously far-fetched: Yale University went to a “voluntarily optional” class schedule (it did not “shut down”) for a few months at the end of the term in mid-1970 because thousands of Black Panther protesters had flooded the campus and its environs, not because of anything Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee did. And while the Panthers made have found many sympathetic supporters among the student body at Yale, neither Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee led or participated in  student demonstrations in support of the Black Panthers, or spoke up in their defense. The above-quoted article also asks “How in the world do you think that these killers got off so easy? Well, maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the Panthers.”  But neither Bill Lee nor Hillary Clinton “defended” the Panthers, either in a public or a legal sense. Bill Lee wasn’t a lawyer, or even a law student; he was simply another Yale undergraduate who had no involvement in the Black Panthers’ trial. Hillary Rodham (as she was known then) wasn’t a lawyer then, either: She was a Yale law student, and like many of her politically-minded fellow law students who saw the latest “trial of the century” taking place just outside the main gate of their school, she took advantage of an opportunity to be involved in the case in a minor, peripheral way by organizing other students to help the American Civil Liberties Union monitor the trials for civil rights violations. Her tangential participation in the trial in no way helped “free” Black Panthers tried for the murder of Alex Rackley In fact, the killers of Alex Rackley didn’t “go free”: Lonnie McLucas was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison,  and Warren Kimbro and George Sams turned state’s evidence and pleaded guilty to second degree murder, serving four years in prison. Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins (who were accused not of killing Rackley, but of being present during his captivity and boiling water to torture him with) went free not due to any efforts on the part of Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee, but because the state failed to sufficiently prove its case against them: the jury deadlocked in favor of acquittal for both defendants, and the trial judge dismissed the charges against both of them. And, of course, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bill Lee had anything to do with the post-trial lives of Seale and Huggins."," ",false,"Uncategorized, black panthers, hillary clinton"
37784,A painting depicting J. Marion Sims' experiments on enslaved Black women is on display at the Alabama state Capitol.,"June 22, 2020",Is There a Painting of J. Marion Sims’ Experiments on Black Women at the Alabama State Capitol?,"  Arturo Garcia  ","Amid the removal and re-evaluation of statues commemorating historical figures in June 2020, a Facebook post that spread widely in June 2020 conflated a statue of a gynecologist who experimented on enslaved Black women with a painting depicting him alongside one of those women.The post by comedian Earthquake (a.k.a. Nathaniel Stroman) features a cropped photograph of the painting, which depicts Sims and two other men observing a woman identified as Lucy. Stroman’s post, which has been shared more than 70,000 times on Facebook, states:This painting hanging in the state capital of #Alabama take a long look at it. #JamesMarianSims – who perfected his surgical techniques by operating Without anesthesia on enslaved #blackwoman because he believed black women Didn’t Feel Pain. he described the experimental surgeries on his enslaved subjects as “So painful, that none but a woman could have borne them. After perfecting the techniques on black enslaved woman with out anesthesia in America, Sims went on to offer the procedure in Europe to wealthy white women who were sedated. This man is arguably the most famous American surgeon of the 19th century. I see him no different than Josef Megele both pure monsters.I hope everyone who goes to the gynecologist will close their eyes for a moment and honor these enslaved black women. I cannot, Cannot fathom the pain these black women endured under this man’s hands. And that painting…. who should be honored? The irony is also in their clothes. Some people, society look at people’s status, respect even on how one is dressed. The one who should be honered and respected is the one who owns no shoes.There is no record of the painting being on display at the Alabama State Capitol building. The full version of the painting shows Sims standing in front of Lucy, while two other women identified as Anarcha Westcott and Betsy watch from behind a makeshift curtain:Robert A. Thom’s painting is part of the series “Great Moments in Medicine,” which he did on commission by the pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis & Co. between 1948 and 1964. In 2007 Pfizer (which had acquired the collection of 45 paintings after buying out another company, Warner-Lambert) gave it to the University of Michigan Museum of Art, where they have been archived.The accompanying text for the painting, composed by Parke-Davis pharmacist George A. Bender, reads:Little did James Marion Sims, M.D., (1813-1883) dream, that summer day in 1845, as he prepared to examine the slave girl, Lucy, that he was launching on an international career as a gynecologic surgeon; or that he was to raise gynecology from virtually an unknown to respected medical specialty. Nor did he realize that his crude back-yard hospital in Montgomery, Alabama, would be the forerunner of the nation’s first Woman’s Hospital, which Sims helped to establish in New York in 1855. Dr. Sims, who became a leader in gynecology in Europe as well as in the United States, served as president of The American Medical Association, 1875-1876; and was honored by many nations.However, the museum’s description of the piece adds more context:By way of blinded valorization, Bender’s text sterilizes Sims’ years-long experimentation on the bodies of “Anarcha, Betsy, Lucy and about nine other unidentified enslaved women and girls” from 1844 to 1849. Eclipsed by Bender’s mythical-heroic account of Sims was the agonizing pain suffered by the patients experimented on before the wide use of anesthetics. At the same time, the enslaved labor responsible for the very construction of Sim’s “crude back-yard hospital” is rendered invisible. As Bender drew heavily upon Sims’ memoir to craft his captions, he, much like Sims, also failed to acknowledge the fact that the enslaved female patients were expected to continue their servitude even as patients. These women not only cooked, cleaned, and cared for the Sims family, but effectively kept the Alabama hospital running, serving as Sim’s surgical nurses throughout the five-year period of their “treatment.”Like Bender’s caption, Thom’s illustration also lionizes Sims, who stands with his arms folded at the head of the hospital scene. The illustration reproduces a racist, medical gaze, as it prompts the observer to join the ranks of other visiting surgeons who ogle Lucy as a medical object of curiosity. Through proper contextualization and careful visual study, we might challenge this supposed “great moment in medicine” and consider the contradictions of “scientific achievement” and the entanglements of violence, slavery, and medicine.While there is no record of the painting of Sims and Lucy being displayed at the Capitol, a separate painting showing Sims standing near Westcott and calling him one of the “medical giants of Alabama,” was on display at the University of Alabama-Birmingham before being removed in 2006. In 2017, Dr. Vanessa Gamble — a physician and historian at George Washington University — reaffirmed in a radio interview that Sims performed thirty surgeries on Westcott alone in the course of his experimentation, which was conducted without anesthesia:There was a belief at the time that black people did not feel pain in the same way. They were not vulnerable to pain, especially black women.

8220,"World closes borders, restricts travel to contain coronavirus spread.","March 14, 2020","Countries around the world on Saturday continued to close borders, impose strict entry and quarantine requirements and restrict large gatherings in efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus."," ","Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it will close all its retail stores worldwide, outside Greater China, until March 27. Apple reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday as the spread of the virus on mainland China slowed dramatically. Countries have shuttered museums, tourist attractions and sporting events to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission, with more than 138,000 people worldwide infected and more than 5,000 dead. Colombia said it will close its borders with Venezuela and stop visitors who have been in Europe or Asia, while a U.S. ban on entry for most people from continental Europe was due to start midnight Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) says Europe has become the pandemic’s current epicenter after reporting more cases and deaths than the rest of world combined, apart from China where the coronavirus originated last December. Saudi Arabia will suspend all international flights for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA said, Taiwan will require travelers from mainland Europe, Britain and Ireland to self-isolate for 14 days, while New Zealand implemented a similar measure for all those entering the country. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also called on cruise ships, a major source of infections in some countries, not to come to New Zealand until June 30. “Alongside Israel, and a small number of Pacific Islands who have effectively closed their border, this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” she said. The country has just six confirmed cases and has had no deaths, but Ardern said that number inevitably would rise. “That is why ultimately, we must go hard and we must go early,” she told reporters. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced a ban on public events with more than 500 people on Friday, joining countries such as Australia where the ban will come into force on Monday. Britain will introduce emergency laws next week to ban mass gatherings, said a government source, an escalation of its crisis plan which critics had said was too relaxed. The Philippines capital Manila, home to 12 million people, announced nighttime curfews on Saturday and urged shopping malls to close for one month. “To limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit the movement of people. We are slowing down the movement of people in Metro Manila,” said Jose Arturo Garcia, general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. While infections continue to climb around the world, in mainland China the number of new cases is falling. The number of new coronavirus cases imported into mainland China from overseas surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections for the first time on Friday, data released by the National Health Commission showed on Saturday. Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those - all in the virus epicenter of Hubei province - were locally transmitted. Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four of the new cases on Friday, down from five a day earlier, were in provincial capital Wuhan. The flu-like virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said. In a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has infected the U.S. House of Representatives passed an aid package that would provide free testing and paid sick leave. The U.S. military said it will halt most domestic travel, extending earlier restrictions on international travel for its more than a million active-duty troops around the world. Travel bans have hammered airlines and travel companies worldwide, while financial markets have been hit by panic selling this week. The impact of the coronavirus on everyday life is also deepening. The Czech government will shut most shops and restaurants from early Saturday, with exceptions including food stores, pharmacies and gas stations. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum and the Moulin Rouge cabaret closed their doors. The Smithsonian museums in Washington were preparing to do so on Saturday and Broadway theaters in New York went dark. The kissing of the Blarney Stone, one of Ireland’s oldest tourist traditions, was suspended. The global sporting calendar has also been left in tatters with major tournaments canceled, postponed or forced to continue without spectators. But sport’s biggest showpiece, the Olympics, will still proceed as planned, according to Tokyo organizers.","/article/us-health-coronavirus-latest-factbox/latest-on-the-spread-of-coronavirus-around-the-world-idUKKBN211148,uk.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O,/article/us-health-virus-estonia/estonia-to-bar-foreign-travelers-from-march-17-idUKKBN21200D",true,Health News
26009,"“The national coin shortage was done intentionally, the Mint is no longer releasing coins into circulation aka this is the beginning of the end of paper money.”","July 6, 2020","Reduced retail activity and a temporary reduction in coin production, both due to COVID-19, caused a shortage.",Tom Kertscher,"Maybe you’ve seen signs in retail stores about a coin shortage, which led to a widely shared conspiracy theory on Facebook. ""National Coin Shortage Just Beginning. The national coin shortage was done intentionally, the mint is no longer releasing coins into circulation aka this is the beginning of the end of paper money,"" the July 2 post says in part, arguing it’s part of a decades-old plan toward enabling a ""soon coming one world government"" to track every private transaction. ""First it will be coins, then one dollar bills and in a not so distant future cash will not be accepted at any store."" The post includes what appears to be a photograph of a sign inside of a grocery store that says: ""Our country is experiencing a national coin shortage"" and asking customers to use exact change or non-cash forms of payment. Some commenters posted images of what appear to be retail store signs with similar messages. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found there was a coronavirus-induced shortage of coins, but no evidence of a plan to eradicate pocket change. Many news outlets reported in June that across the country, coins were hard to find. ""Coins have become scarce as virus lockdowns keep people from emptying their coin jars in exchange for paper bills,"" the New York Times reported. ""The Latest Pandemic Shortage: Coins Are The New Toilet Paper,"" said NPR, describing how banks were running low on nickels, dimes and quarters, in turn leading to shortages at retail outlets. ""With the partial closure of the economy, the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all…it’s kind of stopped,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a House subcommittee. The Fed announced June 11 a ""strategic allocation of coin inventories,"" saying: ""The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin. In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly and the U.S. Mint’s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees."" The Fed also said it would work to ""maximize coin production capacity."" U.S. Mint spokesman Todd Martin told PolitiFact that in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the Mint reduced the number of employees per shift in order to enhance social distancing, leading to a reduction in production of 10% in April and 20% in May. At the same time, reduced sales activity meant retailers were ordering more coins from the Mint because they were receiving fewer of them as people stayed home, he said. Coin production began to ramp up in May with mandatory Saturday overtime, the Mint returned to full production by mid-June, and nearly 1.6 billion coins were produced in June, Martin said. In short, the coin shortage was caused by reduced retail activity and a temporary reduction in production, both due to COVID-19. It was not, as this post suggests, done ""intentionally"" as part of a plan to eliminate paper money.

The two agencies, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Counter-terrorism, agreed to the recommendation and said earlier this month they had taken actions to protect the dogs, according to the OIG. The agencies had resisted halting the program when an initial report on the subject was released in September. The State Department has sent more than 200 dogs to various countries overseas to help prevent terrorism over the past 20 years. The September OIG report raised concerns about Jordan and found “ongoing health and welfare concerns among dogs deployed to Jordan,” which is the largest recipient of the dogs in the explosive-detection program. The report released Friday was an update issued after investigators learned of continuing problems and additional deaths. It found several dogs died or had to be euthanized over the past 18 months, including at least two from heat stroke, one from a preventable parasite and a fourth from a pesticide sprayed in or near its kennel. The report said Jordan has agreed to stop using that pesticide around the kennels. A veterinarian consulted by the OIG said the heat stroke deaths were a result of “negligence and improper care,” and not accidents. In Egypt, the report said at least three dogs died, including one from heat stroke, and that officials there refused to allow State Department personnel to visit the kennels or the airport where the dogs work. The Bureau of Counter-terrorism and Bureau of Diplomatic Security told the State Department’s internal watchdog that they are providing additional equipment and training to host country handlers and veterinarians.

3074,UK’s Johnson pushes his Brexit message as election nears.,,"With two days until Britain’s election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s final push to drive home his key message about Brexit was overshadowed Tuesday by criticism of his ham-fisted response to the image of a sick child sleeping on a hospital floor and allegations that he exploited a terrorist knife attack for political gain."," Jill Lawless And Danica Kirka","Dave Merritt, whose son was killed in last month’s London Bridge attack, said the way the tragedy had been exploited for political ends was “crass and insensitive.” Merritt’s 25-year-old son Jack was one of two people killed when a former convict attacked people at a prisoner rehabilitation event that Merritt was helping to run on Nov. 29. Attacker Usman Khan had served eight years in prison for terrorism offenses, and the attack sparked a political spat about security, the early release of prisoners and funding for the prison and justice systems. Dave Merritt told Sky News that “instead of seeing a tragedy, Boris Johnson saw an opportunity.” “And it was just such an ill-considered intervention and almost like a knee-jerk reaction,” he said. “I think he saw an opportunity to score some points in the election. They immediately said, ‘Oh, this is Labour’s fault - they allowed this to happen. They had this early release policy,’ and so on.” He said the way the tragedy had been exploited for political ends was “crass and insensitive.” He said the family had not been contacted by Johnson or his office since the attack, although Johnson’s office said “the PM has expressed his deepest condolences to Mr. Merritt for his tragic loss - an experience no family should have to go through.” Johnson, meanwhile, tried to focus voters on the prospect of an uncertain result and a divided Parliament, which would endanger his plan to lead Britain out of the European Union on Jan 31. All 650 seats  in the House of Commons seats are up for grabs in the election, which is being held more than two years early in a bid to break the political impasse over Brexit. Opinion polls give the Conservatives a lead over Labour, but all parties are nervous about the verdict of a volatile electorate that is weary after years of wrangling over Brexit. “Polls can be wrong,” Johnson said Tuesday. “We need to be fighting for every vote.” He accuses Labour of offering more “dither and delay” on Brexit. The opposition party says it will negotiate a new divorce deal with the EU and then give voters a choice between leaving on those terms and remaining in the bloc. “Forty-eight hours from now, our country can choose between going forward, punching through the current deadlock ... or we can remain stuck in neutral,” Johnson said during a visit to a construction equipment factory in central England, where he drove a bulldozer through a plastic foam wall with “Gridlock” written on it. Merritt’s interview was another late hurdle in a campaign that had gone smoothly for Johnson, until a newspaper ran a photo of 4-year-old Jack Williment-Barr  sleeping on the floor of the Leeds General Infirmary as he awaited treatment because no bed was free. The opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn painted the boy’s plight as a symptom of Britain’s ailing health system, which has suffered under years of Conservative government austerity measures. A video of the prime minister briefly declining to look at a cellphone photo of Jack on a journalist’s phone — and then placing the phone in his pocket — has been viewed more than 1 million times. The incident quickly became caught up in a storm of social media claims, counterclaims and conspiracies. Several prominent journalists, including the political editors of the BBC and ITV, tweeted a claim by anonymous Conservative officials that a party worker had been punched by a protester while Britain’s health secretary visited the hospital. When footage emerged showing that no assault had taken place, they apologized — but a media storm was already raging. Some social media users circulated claims that the photo of Jack, first published by the Yorkshire Evening Post, was staged. Editor James Mitchinson tweeted his reply to one such reader, explaining how the newspaper had verified the story. “I would be happy to meet you over a coffee to offer you an explanation as to how sophisticated and corrosive the proliferation of fake news is, and what to do to guard against being conned by it,” he wrote. Young Jack later was diagnosed with tonsillitis and flu, and eventually sent home. The controversy about the photo comes amid a campaign marred by misleading social media images and attack ads. Britain’s electoral laws, like those of most countries, were largely written before the dawn of the internet, meaning social media campaigns are mostly unregulated and open to exploitation. With no constraints, such as the strict rules that govern broadcasters, Britain’s political parties have pushed the boundaries of truth, transparency and reality. Labour found itself embarrassed, meanwhile, by the leak of a phone recording to the right-wing political website Guido Fawkes in which the party’s health spokesman suggested that the party would lose Thursday’s election because voters “can’t stand Corbyn.” Jonathan Ashworth said his unguarded remarks were merely banter with a Conservative friend and claimed he had been trying to “psych him out like football managers do.” “Obviously with the benefit of hindsight I’ve been too clever by half and I look like an idiot as a result of doing it,″ Ashworth told the BBC later. “But I thought I was having a private conversation with someone who I’ve always had conversations with over the years. ” ___ Associated Press writer Mike Corder contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit","/72b180c44ca67f73ce5d5ebe21269790,/a6742889e9f1c0b8652d06ba94563864,/1a7ebe07c07e89f7d97a5a3b65795c0b,/Brexit,/c2428e94154242ecd658d2356a1ecfc5",true,"Brexit, AP Top News, Health, General News, Elections, International News, Business, London, Boris Johnson, Terrorism, Europe, London Bridge attack"
12696,"Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children.","March 30, 2017","In an email newsletter, state Sen. Jacqueline Collins accused Gov. Bruce Rauner of calling for the elimination of ""funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children"" each year he's been in office. A Democratic staffer pointed to five instances where Rauner proposed cuts or freezes to these three programs. We verified these instances by looking at Rauner’s current and former budget proposals, a vetoed bill and news stories. Rauner has proposed budgets that would eliminate funding in the areas Collins cites. But his 2015 veto of a bill that contained autism funding was in the context of rejecting 19 budget bills on the grounds that the entire package was unbalanced. His veto message did not specifically mention eliminating autism funding. Rather, he said he was vetoing several bills because he wanted structural reforms as part of a balanced budget which majority Democrats did not send him. Collins’ statement is accurate, but needs clarification and additional information.",Marc Filippino,"Things are getting tense among members of the General Assembly as Illinois continues its historic budget impasse. Democrats and Republicans are hurling attacks at opposition party leaders, hoping to assign blame for the state’s lack of a budget for 22 months. Republicans continue to target Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, while Democrats, like state Sen. Jacqueline Collins of Chicago, often slam Gov. Bruce Rauner. In a Feb. 24 newsletter from state Sen. Collins, she zeroes in on several of Rauner’s claims as she attempts to debunk them. One of her counterclaims said: ""Fact: Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children."" We wondered: Did Rauner actually call for the elimination of these programs each year he’s been in office? Budget proposals and vetoed bills We contacted Kenneth Lowe, a media and outreach specialist for the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, to see where the state senator found her sources. Lowe provided us with five instances from 2015 to 2017 in which the governor announced he intended to  freeze or cut homeless prevention, autism or after-school programs for at-risk youth. We looked into each instance to verify that it actually happened and to see whether it accurately depicts Collins’ claim. • Collins’ claim: On Feb. 18, 2015 Rauner announced his Fiscal Year 2016 budget in which he proposed freezing grant funding for autism and homeless prevention programs at DHS. He also called for the elimination of the After School Matters program at the Illinois State Board of Education. • Our finding: Rauner’s FY16 budget proposal shows the governor did look to freeze funding for homeless and autism programs, as well as cut After School Matters. • Collins’ claim: In April 2015, Rauner announced his plan to freeze funding for autism and homeless prevention. • Our findings: On April 3, 2015, Rauner did, in fact, call for a $26 million suspension in social services and public health grants. The Chicago Tribune reported, ""The Republican’s office released a list of targeted programs…that included funding to pay for…smoking cessation, teen programs, autism, and HIV and AIDS programs, among other things."" The Tribune story showed the governor called for a $1 million cut for autism programs, a $300,000 cut for Assistance for the Homeless and a $3.1 million cut to Teen REACH, an after-school program run by the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for high-risk youth. The cuts were dubbed by Democrats as the ""Good Friday Massacre"" and funding to the programs was restored a few weeks later when the administration reported higher-than-expected tax revenue. • Collins’ claim: In June 2015, Rauner vetoed a bill that would fund autism programs and homeless prevention programs. • Our finding: On June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed HB4165. The bill would have provided $4.3 million to the Autism Diagnosis Education Program and $4.5 million to Homeless Youth Services. It is worth noting, however, that the bill was in a batch of 19 budget bills Rauner vetoed simultaneously under a single veto message that faulted Democrats for passing a budget that was $4 billion in the red. ""We must be partners in enacting a balanced budget that meets critical public needs within the resources available. The surest way to do that is by enacting structural reforms inside government and economic reforms that stimulate our economy and bring new jobs to Illinois,"" Rauner wrote in his veto message. As he has said repeatedly since then, Rauner, at the time, had said he would look to new revenue sources if the General Assembly enacted parts of his ""Turnaround Agenda."" This became the opening salvo in a budget impasse that endures to this day. • Collins’ claim: Governor Rauner’s FY17 budget proposal called for the same types of freezes and cuts from his FY16 budget proposal. • Our finding: Rauner’s budget did call for these freezes and cuts. The Project for Autism, DHS’ Homelessness Prevention program and After School Matter wouldn’t have received funding. • Collins’ claim: Rauner, again, introduced a budget without funding the above-mentioned programs. • Our finding: Rauner’s proposed FY18 budget shows this claim is correct. By looking at Rauner’s budget proposals, vetoed bills and past news stories we found Rauner has called for the elimination and freezing of funding for autism, homelessness and after school programs each year he has been in office. However, Rauner has not been successful in his attempts to eliminate or freeze this funding, a point Collins’ email does not make. 'It’s not pretty’ Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, said claims like the ones in Collins’ email are common these days. Illinois has been without a budget for almost two years, and Mooney said it’s starting to grate on people. ""People inside and outside the legislative process are having their nerves frayed,"" Mooney said. ""There’s a lot of tension, especially in the statehouse because they can’t get their jobs done. That’s frustrating for anybody."" Mooney said this feeling is probably amplified after the 12-bill budget package known as the ""Grand Bargain"" stalled. ""It was the one real attempt the (state) Senate had and it was shot down,"" Mooney said. ""It offered hope and those hopes were dashed. It’s like we’re starting back at square one.""

Bruce Rauner of calling for the elimination of ""funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children"" each year he's been in office.

38318," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has admitted that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40, a cancer-causing virus found in monkeys. ","April 11, 2017",98 Million Americans Were Given Cancer Through Polio Shots,"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","Claims that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40 from 1955 to 1963 are false. Questions about links between SV40 and cancer, and theories that millions of Americans were potentially exposed to SV40 through contaminated polio shots, have been circulating for years. Those rumors came to a head in a 2013 video posted at a YouTube channel operated by an Illinois-based team of paranormal investigators dubbed “Extremum Spiritum Paranormal.” The claim resurfaced in March 2017 with various posts on blog sites that espouse conspiracy theories about health news, world events, vaccines, and geology, just to name a few topics. First and foremost, the claim that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40 from 1955 to 1963 are proven false by the very CDC information that these reports cite. The CDC reports that a total of 98 million people were given vaccines during that period — and that approximately 10-30 million Americans could have received a vaccine tainted with simian virus 40 (SV40). So, the number of people potentially impacted is far fewer than the 98 million total widely reported. Second, links between cancer and SV40 don’t appear to be supported by scientific research, the CDC reports: Some of the polio vaccine administered from 1955 to 1963 was contaminated with a virus called simian virus 40 (SV40). The virus came from the monkey kidney cells used to produce the vaccines. Once the contamination was discovered in the Salk inactivated polio vaccine in use at that time, the U.S. government established requirements for vaccine testing to verify that all new batches of the polio vaccine were free of SV40. Because of research done with SV40 in animal models, there was some concern that the virus could cause cancer. However, evidence suggests that SV40 has not caused cancer in humans. Despite initial fears that SV40 causes cancer in humans, a 2002 study cast doubt on those fears without disproving them completely. The New York Times reported in 2002 that SV40 had been found in the tumor cells taken from people who had four types of cancers that were found to develop in rodents — but it was not clear whether the virus caused those tumors: SV40 can cause cancer in rodents and in cultured human cells. It has been found in some tumors taken from cancer patients. But finding the virus in a tumor does not prove that it caused the tumor. Most large population studies have not found a higher cancer risk in people exposed to the vaccine. There is no blood test that can tell whether a person is infected with SV40, and there are no special steps to take to prevent the rare cancers being studied, researchers said. The report released yesterday was prepared by a 14-member committee on vaccine safety convened by the Institute of Medicine, which advises the government on public health. The report is the fifth in a series of eight that the government commissioned on vaccination. Fear of vaccine side effects has led some parents to shun vaccination, and outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough and measles have resulted, the report said. After analyzing more than 100 studies, the committee said that most evidence argued against a connection between the polio vaccine and cancers, but that those weaknesses in the studies made it impossible to dismiss the potential link. A review of links between SV40 and cancers in humans that was published in 2007 offered a more definitive analysis: “In summary, the most recent evidence does not support the notion that SV40 contributed to the development of human cancers.” In the end, claims that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots are false, and scientific evidence doesn’t appear to support links between human cancer and SV40 that contaminated vaccines from 1955 to 1963. For those reasons, we’re calling this rumor “fiction.” Comments","https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/23/us/study-is-unsure-on-tainted-polio-vaccine-s-cancer-role.html, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/health-medical/, https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-travel-expenses-obama-travel-expenses/, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html, https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F98-million-americans-given-cancer-polio-shots-fiction%2F, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131333, https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F98-million-americans-given-cancer-polio-shots-fiction%2F, https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=98+Million+Americans+Were+Given+Cancer+Through+Polio+Shots-Fiction%21&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F98-million-americans-given-cancer-polio-shots-fiction%2F&via=erumors, https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-organization-wins-contract-rebuild-syrian-airport/, https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F98-million-americans-given-cancer-polio-shots-fiction%2F, https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F98-million-americans-given-cancer-polio-shots-fiction%2F, https://www.truthorfiction.com/author/truthorfiction/",false,Health / Medical
33865,"A stranger who stopped to change a tire on a disabled limo was rewarded for his efforts when the vehicle's passenger, Donald Trump, paid off his mortgage.","March 3, 1998","Even with a straight news story like this, a bit of manufactured memory has changed many people’s recall of the event. There are those who now swear they saw Donald Trump hand over an oversized, Ed McMahon-type check on TV. Likely this “Publisher’s Clearing House” mental image fits in better with our notion of how a celebrity would reward an ordinary fellow, hence the substituted memory.",Snopes Staff,"Reputed to have come from Donald Trump’s publicity people, the following tale found its way into the news media via the magazine Forbes in February 1996: This may well be the public relations gesture of the year. During the 1995 Christmas holidays, Donald Trump and Marla Maples find themselves marooned in their stretch limo with a flat tire on a busy stretch of New Jersey highway. Finally, a passing motorist spots the limo in distress and offers to help the chauffeur change the tire. Driver says, sure. Before the re-tired limo rolls off, the darkened window rolls down and an effusive Trump asks what he and his wife can do to repay the favor. Just send my wife a big bouquet of flowers, says the guy, handing Trump a card with his wife’s name and their address. Two weeks later a gargantuan bouquet of orchids arrives with a card reading, “We paid off your home mortgage, Marla and Donald.” The Trumps flackery won’t reveal the lucky chap’s name, but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $100,000 for the gesture. Eyebrows should have been raised by this tale, as even back in the mid-1990s it was already a recognized urban legend that had been told about many other celebrities. Casting doubt on the notion that it subsequently became a true legend was the lack of checkable details provided by Trump’s people, as exemplified by 1996 news reports that noted “The Trumps flackery won’t reveal the lucky chap’s name, but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $100,000 for the gesture.” Speaking plainly, we have an unsubstantiated rumor of celebrity good-deeding being spread by those who work for a man who courts the limelight at every opportunity. The tale’s details are fuzzy, too: one version has the event occurring while Donald Trump was married to Ivana and driving in Michigan, yet other versions place it during his marriage to Marla and had him driving in New Jersey or in Canada near Casino Niagara. In every case what’s lacking is confirmation from the lad whose mortgage was paid, the limousine driver, or anyone who worked at the tire-changer’s bank (and would thus have been in on the mortgage’s retirement). Is it reasonable to assume someone so rewarded would fail to tell his family, friends, and co-workers about his encounter with a famous millionaire, especially the part about the wealthy one’s repaying a small kindness in so overwhelming a fashion? Is it reasonable that his wife would similarly remain silent? If you think not, you should be asking why the tire-changer’s name is still unknown, why his story didn’t escape into the community where he lives and from there make its way to the media, why you’ve yet to see so much as one televised interview with him. In fact, back in 1997, when the Donald Trump version of the tale was still relatively new, Trump’s office was actively denying its truthfulness: The implausible story making the rounds at Toronto doughnut shops is that somebody’s newphew’s friend’s cousin, Joe, was driving down Highway 401 in his pickup truck when he spotted a white stretch limousine, with its hood up, on the shoulder. Joe, being a good samaritan, stopped to help. Within minutes, he got the limo running and a grateful driver asked for Joe’s card so he could send him a little something. “Nah,” Joe said. “It was nothing. I was just trying to be helpful.” The driver insisted, so Joe gave him a card and forgot about it. A week later, he got a call from his bank informing him that his $160,000 mortgage had been paid off by Donald Trump, who was a passenger in the limo. “We’ve heard the story,” said an irritated-sounding assistant of Mr. Trump’s at his New York office. “No, it isn’t true.” The story also fails the plausibility check: wouldn’t the driver of the limousine be able to change a tire on his own, or at least be able to make a cell phone call to AAA for assistance with a minor mechanical problem? Trump’s first wife, Ivana, could — and indeed did — change a tire when sidelined with a flat, making it all the more surprising Trump’s chauffeur lacked this skill yet apparently kept his job (especially in light of his employer’s notorious impatience with those who fail to perform). Gulling a number of people was The Donald’s own confirmation of the tale during a January 2005 episode of his television series, The Apprentice. When asked about the veracity of this legend by one of those vying for the show’s ultimate prize, Trump simply responded, “That’s true.” For many, his saying so was all the proof that mattered. Yet he is far from the first celebrity to claim an item of contemporary lore as an anecdote from his own life (see our page about the Hare Dryer legend for a number of such examples). Moreover, news accounts from 2016 revealed that Trump had long been posing as a publicist to brag about himself, and he has a decades-old reputation for being less than truthful about himself, as illustrated by this excerpt from a 1997 New Yorker article: Alair Townsend, a former deputy mayor in the Koch administration, once quipped, “I wouldn’t believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized.” In time, this bon mot became misattributed to Leona Helmsley, who was only too happy to claim authorship. Last fall [1996] after Evander Holyfield upset Mike Tyson in a heavyweight title fight, Trump snookered the News into reporting that he’d collected twenty million bucks by betting a million on the underdog. This prompted the Post to make calls to some Las Vegas bookies who confirmed — shockingly! — that nobody had been handling that kind of action or laying odds close to 20-1. Trump never blinked, just moved on to the next bright idea. The legend of the good Samaritan, the disabled car, and the celebrity’s generosity has been told of others over the years. It’s a classic windfall legend. Each of us would like to believe an ordinary kindness on our part would result in manna from heaven falling our way, which is why this legend speaks directly to us. We can see ourselves on the receiving end of all those golden goodies, and it reaffirms our faith in the world in that we want to believe good deeds don’t go unrewarded. Oscar Wilde used a similar plot for his 1891 short story “A Model Millionaire.” In it, Hughie is a lad who has stopped to visit an artist friend. He is momentarily left alone in the company of the wretch the painter is using as his model and is touched by the old man’s tattered appearance. He slips the beggar a gold sovereign, realizing it’s all the mad money he has for the month but that the elderly fellow needs it so much more than he does. The beggar smiles, pockets the coin, and thanks Hughie. We later discover the beggar is in reality Baron Hausberg, a millionaire who for no clearly stated reason enjoys posing for this particular artist. The Baron sends a wedding gift of £10,000 to Hughie as his way of thanking the young man who was moved to help an unfortunate. We also found a Henry Ford version of this legend in a 1954 collection of inspirational tales: Honk-honk, honk-honk, honk-honk-honk. The old-fashioned horn was bellowing as the mechanical contraption came around the bend and rushed along the dusty road. The engine was roaring and the radiator hissing as the long-suffering warrior did twenty-five miles per hour. It was one of the earliest Ford cars; the Methuselah of engineering. Men said it would never die a natural death: it would either commit suicide or be smashed by modern unpredictables. Honk-honk, chug-chug-chug; and the wizened old farmer, with a thick growth of beard darkening his chin, steered his car homeward. Suddenly, ahead of him he saw a beautiful car drawn up by the roadside. It was an immaculate product of modern engineering. Long and low, its lines were fascinating; but it was at a standstill! As the farmer drew nearer he recognized that some kind of engine trouble had interrupted the progress of the other travellers. The shining bonnet of the beautiful car had been lifted, and the chauffeur, with cap pushed well back on his head, was perplexedly staring at the unresponsive engine. With a sound of squealing brakes the old car was brought to a halt, and as a rusty door swung open, the farmer came out to ask, “What’s wrong?” The stranger responded, “I don’t know. The engine has stopped.” The newcomer looked inside the bonnet, and then announced his readiness to tow the car to the garage seven miles away. The stranded driver casually lifted his eyebrows and answered, “You’ll tow me to the garage!” What with? That!” And his finger indicated the noisy model T. The farmer’s chest expanded, and he seemed about to explode; but the eruption died, and he answered, “Yes, with that. You’ll see.” He lifted a rope from the back of his car, placed it in position, and said, “Now get in, and I’ll show you.” Slowly the great car was taken along the roads, and finally, as the garage came into view, the farmer smiled and prepared to stop. “Well! She did it, didn’t she?” The two drivers were then joined by a third man, who all the while had been sitting in the back of the broken-down limousine. Quietly he asked, “What do I owe you, sir?” The farmer’s eyes narrowed as he repeated, “What do you owe? Nothing. It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it. No. Nothing. Pleased to help you. Good day.” He coiled his rope, climbed into the driving seat, and soon disappeared in a cloud of dust. The silent passenger calmly watched his departure, and then smiled. He nodded and quietly repeated to himself, “It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it.” In due course the wheezy, asthmatical model T reached the end of its career. It has not been placed on record whether the end came suddenly, or whether the closing months were marred by internal disorders. The fact is that the old car succumbed to the ravages of time, and was given a respectable funeral in the junk yard. The day after the ceremony, the bereaved farmer was somewhat astounded to find a new Ford car standing a few yards from his door. The old man paused. Had someone called? No! He rubbed his eyes; the car was so new, so glossy, so desirable. He walked around it, and then opened the door to inspect the interior. He saw a message written on a label tied to the steering wheel. “It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it.” The passenger who had offered in vain to pay for the towing of his car had been the great manufacturer — Henry Ford. Probably he had been fascinated by the achievement of one of his earlier models, and when its proud owner refused remuneration, he thought of another way to pay his debt. Probably he commissioned the garage owner to keep watch, and when the old model T ceased to function, to present, with Henry Ford’s compliments, a new car to the kind-hearted farmer. In 1989 the variation of the moment of the unrecognized celebrity rescued by a Samaritan starred Mrs. Nat King Cole. Car troubles supposedly stranded her on the shoulder of a Los Angeles freeway, and she was said to have rewarded the kind man who stopped to render assistance with a new car (variously reported as a Cadillac, Lincoln, or Rolls-Royce.) In 1997 a version of the Mrs. Nat King Cole legend tied to the death of her husband was circulating on the Internet. It appears to have been lifted word for word from the 1997 book Chicken Soup for the Woman’s Soul: One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African-American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down, and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her — generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry! However, she wrote down his address, thanked him, and drove away. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man’s door. To his surprise, a giant combination console color TV and stereo record player were delivered to his home. A special note was attached. The note read:  Dear Mr. James: Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes but my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband’s bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others. Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.” Though it’s a lovely story, it too didn’t happen. Nat King Cole died of lung cancer at dawn on 15 February 1965 in Santa Monica, California. He was hospitalized in December 1964, and on 25 January 1965 his left lung was removed. At least from the date of his operation until his death, Maria Cole was with him every day. There was no opportunity for her to have been stranded in the rain beside an Alabama highway in the weeks leading up to her husband’s death. She was sitting with him when he passed away, and none of the newspapers that commented on her vigil made mention of a last-minute dash to the hospital, an automotive breakdown, or a helpful Samaritan who got her there in time. Another version of the car breakdown legend gives the famous person as Perry Como and has him mailing his rescuer a set of keys to a new car. This tale is told as happening all over the place, so I wonder at Perry’s ability to buy all these people cars but not provide himself with reliable transportation. Yet another twist has the disabled car story happening to Como’s wife, and the payoff she provides is either a color TV or tickets to her husband’s upcoming concert. It’s also told of Mrs. Leon Spinks, and the reward she grants are tickets to her hubby’s upcoming fight in New Orleans. (Moral of the story: if you want the big ticket items, don’t settle for rescuing the wife of a celebrity; hold out for the man himself.) In February 2000, a version starring Bill Gates began circulating on the Internet: Apparently a couple returning home from a skiing trip in British Columbia spots a disabled car at the side of the road and a man in distress. Being good citizens they stop to help. The car has either a flat tire and the Good Samaritan fixes it quickly. The man was very grateful, but had no cash with him to reward them, so asked for their name and address so he could send them a little something. A week later the couple receives a call from their banker stating that their mortgage had been paid and $10,000 had been deposited in their account by a very grateful Bill Gates. Getting back to Donald Trump, we find that on at least one verifiable occasion he’s known to have bestowed largesse on a helpful stranger. Trump’s 79-year-old mother was mugged in 1991, suffering broken bones and severe facial bruises. A passing truck driver who witnessed the assault brought down the mugger and handed him over to justice. (The robber was later sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison). The Donald had dinner with the rescuer, his sister, and his son; offered the Samaritan a better job; and gave him a check for an undisclosed amount."," ",false,"Politics Politicians, donald trump"
4993,Santa Barbara Zoo’s elderly elephant Little Mac euthanized.,,"Little Mac, a 48-year-old Asian elephant that was a fixture at the Santa Barbara Zoo for nearly all her life, was euthanized this week after a sharp decline in health, officials said."," ","The zoo said Little Mac was euthanized around 7 p.m. Wednesday in her exhibit yard, surrounded by keepers and staff who cared for her over the years. She had been in what the zoo called hospice care after chronic problems with her teeth and arthritis in her legs were compounded by the onset of other medical problems in June, said Julie Barnes, the zoo’s vice president of animal care and health. “She continued to decline in spite of our best efforts, especially in the past two weeks,” Barnes said in a statement. “We had exhausted the medical options available that would allow her to have a good quality of life. It was time to let her go.” Little Mac came to the zoo from Mysore, India, in 1972 with another female Asian elephant in exchange for six California sea lions. At the time she was a 1½-year-old, 4-foot-tall (1.2-meter) apparent orphan found in a forest. She was named by Herb Peterson, the owner of several Santa Barbara-area McDonald’s restaurants who paid for the airline flight. Her companion, Sujatha, had been born to an elephant that worked in a logging camp. Sujatha was 47 when she was euthanized on Oct. 16, 2018, due to problems related to old age. Barnes said that Little Mac hadn’t shown any signs of depression or concerning behaviors after Sujatha’s death and if she hadn’t suddenly declined she likely would have been considered for transfer to a sanctuary or other facility where she could have been introduced to other elephants. Her death marks the end of the Santa Barbara Zoo’s elephant program. The zoo noted that it is offering staff and visitors resources for dealing with grief.",https://www.sbzoo.org/,true,"Animals, Elephants, Health, General News, Travel, Santa Barbara, Travel, Asia Pacific, U.S. News"
27177,The Trump Administration’s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.,"December 11, 2018","Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.",Alex Kasprak,"In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not “sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.” Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting “a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved” — in effect putting a “pause” on all research that relied on fetal tissue. ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power. ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory’s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our … humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). Such mice develop chronic and latent HIV infections. We have demonstrated that HIV viral loads in these mice can be suppressed to levels undetectable by highly sensitive PCR tests for viremia and provirus. Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told Science that the HHS “pause” on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:  What happened in September was that my NIH collaborator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories [Kim Hasenkrug] was informed that he could no longer order fetal tissue from the sole source supplier, ABR, and so we [were told that we] could complete the [initial] experiment that [had already been set up], but in science you need to do multiple experiments. You can’t depend upon one experiment to see whether it’s repeatable, etc. So essentially this ban on fetal tissue stopped the line of investigation. Speaking to Science, Greene said that “Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML’s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.” In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication’s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think — or realize — such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September “put a pause in place” for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, “an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your [7 December 2018 Science story]. We are looking into why this did not occur.”  In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. “To my knowledge … we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.” If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have “acted upon it in a millisecond.” We also reached out to the director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review’s impact on the study but have not received a response. However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they “put a pause in place” on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration’s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists’ efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is “clearly a policy that’s … reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that’s now impacting our science.” Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in Science:  On 11 September, 45 anti-abortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were “shocked and dismayed” by the FDA contract [with ABR]. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract. Reacting to HHS’s actions [on 24 September], Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: “My instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.”"," ",true,"Politics, abortion, fetal tissue, HIV"
1914,Judge blocks graphic cigarette warnings.,"November 7, 2011","A federal judge blocked a rule requiring tobacco companies to display graphic images on cigarette packs, such as a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a hole in his throat.","Alina Selyukh, Jeremy Pelofsky","Combination picture of new graphic cigarette packages, released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration June 21, 2011, shows a varied collection of a man on a ventilator, diseased lungs and dead bodies were among the graphic images for revamped U.S. tobacco labels, unveiled by health officials who hope the warnings will help smokers quit. REUTERS/U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Handout District Judge Richard Leon sided on Monday with tobacco companies and granted a temporary injunction, saying they would likely prevail in their lawsuit challenging the requirement as unconstitutional because it compels speech in violation of the First Amendment. The Food and Drug Administration in June released nine new warnings to go into effect in September of 2012, the first change in U.S. cigarette warning labels in 25 years. Cigarette packs already carry text warnings from the U.S. Surgeon General. The new warnings must cover the top half of the front and back of cigarette packs and 20 percent of printed advertisements and must contain color graphics depicting the health consequences of smoking, including diseased lungs, dead bodies and rotting teeth. Congress instructed FDA to impose the new labels as part of 2009 legislation making the agency responsible for regulating tobacco products. “The sheer size and display requirements for the graphic images are anything but narrowly tailored,” Leon wrote in a 29-page opinion. Just because Congress ordered the size and placement of the new warnings before charging the FDA with carrying out the mandate, “doing so does not enable this requirement to somehow automatically pass constitutional muster,” he said. The content of the images would also not likely survive constitutional muster because the FDA did not attempt to narrowly tailor those either, the judge said. The tobacco lawsuit is the latest effort by corporations to assert a right to free speech, a high-profile legal battle that could end up before the Supreme Court. Reynolds American Inc’s R.J. Reynolds unit, Lorillard Inc, Liggett Group LLC and Commonwealth Brands Inc, owned by Britain’s Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, sued the FDA in August. They argued the new graphic warnings force them to “engage in anti-smoking advocacy” on the government’s behalf, breaching their right to free speech. The Obama administration’s options include appealing Leon’s ruling or the FDA could try to rewrite the rules. FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Yao said the agency did not comment on proposed, pending or ongoing litigation. Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said the department was aware of the decision and was reviewing it. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States, accounting for one in every five deaths every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 21 percent of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, a number little changed since 2004. Worldwide, tobacco kills nearly 6 million people every year, including more than 600,000 nonsmokers, according to the World Health Organization, which has repeatedly called for graphic images to appear on tobacco packs, saying the pictorial warnings actually work. The tobacco industry had asked Leon to block the FDA’s new requirements, pending a final decision on their constitutionality. They argued they needed a quick ruling because they would have to start in November or December and spend millions of dollars to comply with the requirements. Justice Department attorneys had argued that the money was a small fraction of the companies’ net sales, so they would not suffer irreparable harm without the temporary injunction. Government attorneys said the labels conveyed the dangers of smoking more effectively than words alone, and were needed to stop more people from smoking, especially teenagers. Judge Leon said the images provoked an emotional response rather than just providing factual and noncontroversial information, crossing the line into using company advertising for government advocacy. Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer representing Lorillard, called Leon’s ruling a “vindication for the well-established First Amendment principle that the government may not compel speech in the commercial area.”   He said the case was in its early stages and there was a “good chance” it will eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The Dow Jones tobacco index, whose components include Altria, Lorillard and Reynolds American, was just 0.05 percent higher in afternoon trading amid mixed trading for broader U.S. stock indexes as investors kept a worried eye on European debt problems. Altria Group is not part of the lawsuit. The case is R.J Reynolds Tobacco Co et al v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-cv-1482."," ",true,Health News
34690,"Over 37 million bees were killed by a large GMO cornfield planted in Ontario, Canada.","November 7, 2014","Millions of bees died off in Canada, but the cause of those deaths was not linked to a GMO cornfield.",David Mikkelson,"In October 2014, a rumor started circulating online that a GMO corn field in Ontario, Canada, was the cause of more than 37 million bee deaths. While it is true millions of bees were found to have died around that time in Canada, the cause of those deaths has not been definitively linked to GMO corn. The rumor started after OrganicHealth.com published an article titled 37 Million Bees Found Dead in Ontario, Canada After Planting Large GMO Corn Field:  Millions of bees dropped dead after GMO corn was planted few weeks ago in Ontario, Canada. The local bee keeper, Dave Schuit who produces honey in Elmwood lost about 37 million bees which are about 600 hives. “Once the corn started to get planted our bees died by the millions,” Schuit said. The Organic Health article was basically a repurposed version of two articles published by The Post in June 2013 and CBC News in August 2013. Neither of those articles mentioned GMO corn. In fact, the Organic Health article never truly blamed GMO corn for killing millions of bees. Other than the title and the first sentence, Organic Health steered away from the idea that a GMO corn field caused 37 million bees to die in Canada and instead aligned with the conclusions drawn by the Post and CBC News: The culprit behind the devastating bee deaths in Canada is believed to be neonicotinoid pesticides: “What seems to be deadly to bees is that the neonicotinoid pesticides are coating corn seed and with the use of new air seeders, are blowing the pesticide dust into the air when planted.” While the idea that GMO corn is causing millions of bees to perish around the world is intriguing, it is also unproven. The same could be said for neonicotinoid pesticides, of course, but the evidence is starting to tip towards the latter. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), an arm of Health Canada that regulates pesticides, investigated the bee death incident in Ontario and found that neonicotinoids were likely to blame:  In the spring and summer of 2012, Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) received a significant number of honey bee mortality reports from the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario. A portion of these mortalities were determined to be associated with spray drift, however, an unusually high number of reports of honey bee mortalities were received from beekeepers in corn growing regions of Ontario and Quebec. The majority of reports were from southern Ontario, involving over 40 beekeepers and 240 different bee yard locations. Additionally, one report was received from Quebec involving eight bee yards. Timing and location of these honey bee mortalities appeared to coincide with planting corn seed treated with insecticides. The information evaluated suggests that planting of corn seeds treated with the nitro guanidine insecticides clothianidin and/or thiamethoxam contributed to the majority of the bee mortalities that occurred in corn growing regions of Ontario and Quebec in Spring 2012. The likely route of exposure was insecticide contaminated dust generated during the planting of treated corn seed. The unusual weather conditions in the spring of 2012 were likely also a contributing factor. The Ontario Beekeeper’s Association, which claims that Ontario has seen a 35% decrease in honey bees over the last two years, recently started a petition calling for a provincial ban on neonicotinoids:  Ontario’s bees are dying in massive numbers due to the pervasive use of neonicotinoid pesticides on our agricultural field crops. Fully a third of our food relies on pollinators: without bees, Ontario’s food supply could be in serious trouble. Further, these chemicals leach into soils, groundwater and waterways, and can persist for years, killing not only bees, but other pollinators, aquatic insects, amphibians and birds. We already have sufficient evidence to prove that neonicotinoid pesticides are killing our bees. Canada’s Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency has confirmed that last year’s widespread bee deaths in Ontario were caused by neonicotinoid pesticides. As well, dozens of independent, peer reviewed scientific research studies have concluded that these pesticides pose a significant threat to bees and other wildlife. Furthermore, science and experience has shown that neonicotinoids don’t really increase agricultural yield in the long run."," ",unproven,Politics
10392,Selenium Supplements Might Give Modest Benefit Against Cholesterol,"May 17, 2011","This story about selenium’s effects on cholesterol points out some key limitations in a new study. It explains that the trial was conducted in Britain, where people generally have lower selenium intakes than in the U.S. — so the results may not apply here. And it was careful not to suggest that selenium might be an alternate to statin drugs or other remedies for high cholesterol. The story did not provide as many details as the competing Reuters report on this study, however. The effects of selenium on cholesterol levels were not quantified, and there was no information on costs. Selenium is a component of multivitamins taken by millions of Americans on a daily basis. Selenium supplements are also taken individually in the hope that they will ward off chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. While there isn’t much evidence that supplementation reduces the risk of these diseases in healthy individuals (and might increase the risk of diabetes), the results of this new research at least provide some reassurance that selenium won’t raise your cholesterol, which might increase your cardiovascular risk."," ","The cost of selenium supplements probably isn’t a big issue for most individual consumers, but across our society the costs are substantial. Some discussion of this would have been appropriate. Although the story correctly explains that selenium supplements are not an effective means to reduce cholesterol levels, the coverage is too vague when it says that individuals taking selenium “experienced a slight drop in both bad cholesterol (LDL) and overall cholesterol levels” and that “Good cholesterol (HDL) levels rose a bit solely among those assigned to the highest selenium dosage.” Instead of relying on imprecise descriptions such as “slight” and “a bit,” the story should have provided the actual numbers, as the competing Reuters story did. The Reuters story also described the ranges for normal and elevated cholesterol levels, which helps puts the changes observed into context. The story was a little confusing on this point. It initially says that selenium’s safety “has not been studied,” but later quotes a researcher who says there is an increased risk for type 2 diabetes with selenium supplements in individuals whose blood levels are already high. The story does note that there were no serious side effects in the selenium supplement users participating in this study, but it could have qualified this by mentioning the relatively short duration of the study (6 months) and the potential for problems with longer-term use. Too much selenium can also, in rare cases, result in condition called selenosis, which includes symptoms such as gastrointestinal upsets, hair loss, white blotchy nails, garlic breath odor, fatigue, irritability, and mild nerve damage. A toss-up here, but since the story indicated that this was not a risk-free intervention and reported on the study findings as appropriate, we’ll rule it satisfactory. The story discusses some limitations of the study, including the fact that participants were all from the UK, where selenium intake is lower than in the U.S; Americans won’t necessarily experience the same cholesterol reductions seen in the study. The story is also careful to explain that selenium had a “minor impact” on cholesterol and is “not advisable as an effective means to combat high cholesterol.” We wish that the story had included more information about the design of the study, particularly the dosage of selenium taken in each of the 3 supplementation groups. The story describes the dosages as “low” “intermediate” or “high,” but it should have quantified them. Overall, though, we’ll call it good enough for a satisfactory. The story doesn’t exaggerate the prevalence of selenium deficiency or otherwise try to scare people into taking supplements. An independent expert source was quoted and there were no obvious conflicts of interest that weren’t disclosed. The story notes that bread in the U.S. is a good source of selenium, and that U.S. consumers generally have no need to take a supplement. So, there’s really no need to talk about alternatives. We’ll rule it not applicable. The story doesn’t really explain what selenium is, why someone would want to take a selenium supplement, or where one can find them. While many readers will know the answers to these questions, selenium is obscure enough, in our view, to warrant at least some background context on these issues. The story states that many other studies have looked at the cholesterol impact of selenium supplements, with differing results. We couldn’t find a news release that was issued for this particular study. But by including an independent expert source, the story assures us that it didn’t rely exclusively on PR materials."," ",true,"HealthDay,Supplements"

Trump shook hands at a conference with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and Conservative Political Action Conference. Schlapp days earlier had had contact with a man who has been confirmed to have the coronavirus. Schlapp reportedly has no symptoms.",Tom Kertscher,"A Facebook post on March 9, 2020, the day stock markets were rattled by news about the coronavirus, carried this headline about President Donald Trump and the Conservative Political Action Conference: ""Trump shakes hands with CPAC Chairman — President Trump has come into contact with a potential coronavirus sufferer!"" The post, shared by United Kingdom-based Daily Mail, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline exaggerates what happened and raises alarm over the possibility that Trump has been exposed to coronavirus. Based on current reporting, that’s not what we know. A Daily Mail spokesman told us the post would be edited to make it clearer. Indeed, before we published this check, they changed it to read, ""The chairman of the American Conservative Union has revealed that he interacted with a 55-year-old man infected with coronavirus before shaking hands with Donald Trump."" Let’s take a look. The Daily Mail post includes a looping video clip of Trump on stage at CPAC and shaking hands with a white-haired man before taking the lectern for his speech. Trump spoke on the final day of that conference, which was sponsored by the American Conservative Union and held in National Harbor, Md., Feb. 26-29, 2020. The words that appear as the Daily Mail video plays state that the man, identified as the CPAC chairman, said he had ""interacted with an infected man recovering in New Jersey"" before greeting Trump. On March 7, 2020, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that someone who’d traveled to the state Feb. 27-March 1 for the conference was confirmed to have COVID-19. ""Those who attended or worked at the conference may be at some risk for acquiring COVID-19,"" Hogan’s statement read. The next day, March 8, 2020, the Washington Post reported the following: The man Trump shook hands with is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and CPAC. Schlapp said he briefly interacted personally early in the four-day conference with a man infected with the coronavirus. The man has not been identified. Schlapp said he used hand sanitizer regularly during the conference and had not had any symptoms before or after shaking hands with Trump. He said he has been in touch with his own doctor and with the infected patient, who is being quarantined in New Jersey. The White House has maintained that Trump was never in direct contact with the infected person and does not have any symptoms. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said in a statement on March 8, 2020, that he ""briefly interacted"" with the infected person while at CPAC and would self-quarantine at his Texas home ""out of an abundance of caution."" Rep. Paul A. Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted that same day that he and three of his staff members are under self-quarantine ""after sustained contact at CPAC"" with the person who has the virus. Schlapp told the New York Times he had had incidental contact with the infected person. The Times reported March 9, 2020, that the man, a 55-year-old New Jersey resident, was in stable condition in a hospital. As for the spread of coronavirus, we’ve reported that: Older people and those with preexisting health conditions are more at risk of developing complications from the coronavirus. For the American public, the immediate risk of coronavirus remains relatively low. The best ways to prevent the spread of the virus are to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, cover your sneezes and coughs, and disinfect your home. A headline on a Daily Mail video shared on Facebook claimed Trump has come into contact with a ""potential coronavirus sufferer."" Trump shook hands with Matt Schlapp, a man who says he had been in contact days earlier with someone who is reportedly being treated for the virus. Schlapp says he has had no symptoms of the illness. Some may argue third-hand contact indicates possible exposure for Trump, but such a conclusion ignores available evidence. While the Daily Mail did qualify its assertion by using the word ""potential"" in ""potential coronavirus sufferer,"" the headline (which ended in an exclamation point) nevertheless led readers to believe that Trump’s exposure is worthy of alarm. Indeed, anyone in a population could be a ""potential"" coronavirus sufferer.

24601,"The Democrat-backed health care reform plan ""will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.","August 7, 2009",Boehner says Democrats' health care plan would subsidize abortions,Robert Farley,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word ""abortion"" was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan ""will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars."" Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, ""As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station."" Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money ""to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion."" The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a ""radical departure from the status quo,"" because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill ""abortion neutral."" A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, ""It's still the government running the whole plan."" ""The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan,"" Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a ""misleading campaign"" that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. ""The goal should be to maintain the current policies,"" Korzen said. ""That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim."" And, he said, ""there's a lot to be happy about,""  including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. ""We thought they got everything they wanted,"" Crane said. ""We are confused why they continue to push."" Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement .","https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/psrh/full/3607204.pdf, https://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1909178,00.html, http://healthcare.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGI1YjEwOTNjYmMzODBiYjJkNjliOTljODk2ZTBjOGE, http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090730/hr3200_capps_1.pdf, https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090805/ap_on_go_co/us_health_care_overhaul_abortion, http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf, http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/07/29/frc-spot-looks-to-tie-public-option-to-abortion-funding/, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/us/politics/31health.html?_r=2, https://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/07/21/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5178972.shtml, http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs2003-1-set.cfm, https://factcheck.org/2009/07/surgery-for-seniors-vs-abortions/, http://help.senate.gov/BAI09A84_xml.pdf, http://www.nrlc.org/AHC/Index.html, https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RICA.pdf, http://www.catholics-united.org/?q=node/265, https://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2009/07/22/index.html, https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090722/ap_on_go_co/us_health_care_overhaul_abortion, http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/issues/abortion/access-to-abortion/health-care-reform.html, https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/1/gpr100112.html, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/25475.html",false,"Abortion, National, Health Care, Taxes, John Boehner, "

But the most recent report that includes both national and state-by-state figures show that Rhode Island’s rate was actually less than the national average. We rule the claim False. (To check our sources and find additional information, go to the extended version of this article at PolitiFactRI.com.)",John Hill,"Rhode Island was treated to an interesting do-the-ends-justify-the-means debate last week when the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. Besides objecting to the treatment of the animals involved, the committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in the Ocean State. To drive that point home, the committee has begun an advertising campaign with posters on five Providence bus shelters, claiming ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average. But Brown researchers are not helping teens. Instead, they are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets."" We’ll pass on whether getting pigs drunk is a waste of federal money. But we wondered whether Rhode Island’s rate of teen binge drinking is that high. Two federal agencies that track teenage alcohol use, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, define binge drinking as having five or more drinks at the same occasion, at the same time or within a couple of hours. Physicians Committee spokeswoman Jeanne S. McVey said the group came up with its statistic by using data from two federal agencies that track, among other things, alcohol use by the nation’s teenagers. She cited a 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found that 7.2 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 nationwide reported at least one instance of binge drinking over the previous 30 days. But that study didn’t break down its findings by state. For a Rhode Island number, McVey said, the committee turned to a 2013 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, a survey of a cross section of the nation’s high school students, done every two years. According to documents posted on the state Health Department website, that survey found that in Rhode Island, 15.1 percent of responding students in grades 9 through 12 said they had at least one binge-drinking experience in the previous 30 days. Rhode Island’s 15.1 percent, as reported in the CDC study, is more than twice the national average of 7.2 percent, as reported in the SAMHSA study, McVey said. But those are numbers from two different studies. Is it legitimate to compare them in that way? No, said statistician Jeffrey E. Jarrett, a professor of finance decision science at the University of Rhode Island. To be valid, Jarrett said, comparisons must be drawn from the same data -- in other words, surveys that ask the same questions to the same people. Even a slight difference in wording between questionnaires can make a difference. ""The only way to compare is to compare things within the same study,"" he said. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, we returned to the CDC study. The agency has not yet compiled national averages for its 2013 study. But in its 2011 survey, the Rhode Island teen binge-drinking rate was 18.3 percent, compared with 21.9 percent for the nation as a whole. So the Rhode Island rate was actually less than the national one, not double. When we pointed out the flaws in the committee’s methodology, McVey acknowledged that the organization could have been more careful. ""We now see that we should have had an expert in statistics double check, because we were comparing one set of national statistics to one set of local statistics,"" McVey said. "" … If we were to do it over again, we would certainly word it differently."" ""Our larger point is true,"" she added. ""Federal funds should go to helping people rather than to animal experiments that often do not result in treatment for human patients.""

590,New Delhi declares public emergency as pollution at year's worst.,"March 30, 2016",Authorities in New Delhi declared a public health emergency on Friday and closed schools and all construction activity until next week as air pollution in the city hit its worst level this year.,Neha Dasgupta,"A thick haze has hung over the Indian capital this week caused by plumes of toxic smoke from farm fires raging in neighbouring states. An index measuring the level of a deadly air pollutant hit 484 on a scale of 500 on Friday, the government’s Central Pollution Control Board, the worst this year. The index measures the level of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that goes deep into the lungs. Anything above 400 poses a risk for people with respiratory illnesses and can also affect even those with healthy lungs. Some companies advised employees to avoid exposure to toxic air and work from home. “We have been advised to stay at home on Monday,” said Anuj Rawat, an account director at Kantar, the market research arm of British advertising major WPP. Kantar employs around 400 people at its office in New Delhi, Rawat said. The Environment Pollution Control Authority, which is leading the effort to tackle Delhi’s pollution, said: “We have to take this as a public health emergency as air pollution is now hazardous and will have adverse health impacts on all, but particularly our children.”  It banned all construction work in the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people and its neighbouring cities until Nov. 5. Each year, farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana burn crop residue to prepare for the sowing season, ignoring  government warnings. According to government-run monitor SAFAR, satellite pictures had captured nearly 3,200 incidents of stubble burning on Thursday in Haryana and Punjab that contributed to 44% percent of Delhi’s pollution. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal offered free masks on Friday and ordered schools shut till Nov. 5 to protect children. The toxic air has left several Bangladeshi cricket players with sore throats and itchy eyes ahead of their Twenty20 match against India on Sunday. “Government knew an emergency situation was approaching and did not take substantive steps on stubble burning or big industrial polluting sources,” said Sunil Dahiya, an energy and air pollution analyst at Greenpeace. “A public health emergency situation began at least 10 days ago.”",/article/us-india-pollution-cricket/itchy-eyes-sore-throat-but-bangladesh-ok-with-delhi-air-idUKKBN1XB41J,true,Environment
2581,"Sun, sand and root canal: Medical tourism booms in Costa Rica.","November 26, 2012","When Canadian house cleaner Marlene Trithardt needed a tooth replaced, she drove past her local dentist’s office in Alberta and flew to the beach paradise of Costa Rica - to save money.",Isabella Cota,"Trithardt is one of a growing number of North Americans who turn south for medical care lured by lower prices, contributing close to 0.8 percent of Costa Rica’s gross domestic product. “I chose to come here because I find in Alberta the prices are about 80 percent higher than in Costa Rica,” says Trithardt, 57, who makes $30,000 a year. Her treatment will cost $4,000. But even including airfare, hotels and meals for two weeks, the total amount is lower than the $10,000 she said she was expecting to pay for the dental care alone in Canada. In the bargain, Trithardt got to take a few days to visit Costa Rica’s national parks. Around 40,000 medical tourists visited Costa Rica last year, compared to 36,000 in 2010 and 30,000 in 2009. Most of them are American and Canadian, according to the country’s tourism institute, ICT. Of that number, almost 15,000 of them traveled for dental care, said Massimo Manzi, director at Promed, the council for international promotion of medicine in Costa Rica. Manzi estimates that medical tourism brought in $196 million to Costa Rica’s health industry in 2011, with patients spending an additional $84 million in hotels, meals, travel and shopping. That makes for a total of $280 million spent on medical tourism in 2011, compared to $252 million in 2010. Costa Rica competes for medical tourists with the likes of India, Brazil, Panama and Mexico, and its proximity to the United States gives it an advantage over Asian and South American destinations. And while some doctors in the United States discourage traveling abroad for cheaper treatment - saying the quality may not be vetted and that follow-up care is lacking - technology and care standards in the private sector are perceived by the medical community and patients alike to be high. The dental tourism niche is booming in Costa Rica, a country of 4.5 million people best known for its white sand beaches and lush rainforests. Now accounting for 36 percent of all medical tourism, that figure is seen rising to 50 percent over the next two years, said Promed’s Manzi. Trithardt’s doctor, 32-year-old Costa Rican Ignacio Vargas, says tourists represent 70 percent of his business. Virtually all medical tourists are uninsured and pay their own way, said Brad Cooke, head of Medical Tours Costa Rica, a travel agency that works exclusively with patients. As a result, healthcare reform passed in the United States that will require Americans to get basic insurance by 2014 could reduce demand. However that reform does not cover dental care. “We had a gentleman, for example, who was interested in coming in for a knee procedure about six months ago and then he decided not to come. He said he’d rather wait and see if Obamacare would cover it”, said Cooke. A few insurance companies in the U.S. like Cigna Corp, Satori and Blue Cross Blue Shield are already expanding their supplier network to include overseas clinics and facilities to help cut costs. “What we’re hoping, and it would be an important step, is that these insurance companies offer an incentive to those who choose the international option,” Manzi said. Costa Rican health officials are grappling with booming demand as it is. “We are learning how to handle this demand so that we don’t get to a point where we are facing waiting periods which would turn patients away from Costa Rica,” said Health Minister Daisy Corrales. To help ensure that demand can be met, Promed works as a guide for investors looking to build new clinics and hospitals that can welcome tourist-patients."," ",true,Health News
1541,"Raised for meat in South Korea, dogs head for new homes in U.S.","January 10, 2017","“You’re OK, you’re OK,” Lola Webber, a campaign manager with the Humane Society International (HSI), whispers to a lab-mix puppy, cradling her in a jacket as dozens of dogs bark in nearby cages.",Nataly Pak,"The puppy is moved from a rusty cage on a dog-meat farm in South Korea to a plastic crate, given the name Demi, and placed in a truck where she begins the long journey to a shelter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to be put up for adoption. “As soon as they’re ready for adoption, we find that there are line-ups of people - literally people would line up at shelters - in the U.S. to adopt these dogs because people are so engaged by their sad and compelling stories,” said Andrew Plumbly, another campaign manager for the HSI. Demi was one of 10 dogs rescued on Tuesday from a farm in Wonju, 90 km (55 miles) from the South Korean capital, Seoul,  where 200 dogs were being raised for human consumption, to start new lives as pets under the HSI’s campaign. The farm is the sixth that the group has helped close down in South Korea since 2015, and follows six-months of negotiations, medical examinations and vaccinations. Because airline flights can only carry a limited number of dogs a day, it will take a couple of weeks for HSI to rescue all 200 of the dogs at the farm. Hygiene there is “non-existent”, Plumbly said, with waste collecting beneath cages where dogs are exposed to extremes of weather and fed once a day, according to HSI. The owner of the farm, who has been in the business for 30 years and declined to be identified, cited poor health as a reason for getting out of the business. Consumption of dog meat is on the decline in South Korea, where it is mainly eaten by older people and dogs are increasingly popular as pets. Still, HSI estimates there are 17,000 dog-meat farms in the country. Humane Society International hopes the government will ban the breeding of dogs for meat ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea. Recently, the mayor of the city of Seongnam, Lee Jae-myung, who is running for president, ordered the closure of a big dog-meat section of a city market. Seafood will be sold there instead."," ",true,Environment
9105,New blood test may transform the way cancer is monitored and treated,"August 17, 2017","There are 429 words in this news release. Nearly half are contained in just two exuberant quotes from Stanford researchers. If the study itself backed up the claims made in these quotes, we would applaud the release for its economy of language. As it stands, the release needed much more information to help journalists and other readers understand that this is a very limited study that may or may not turn into a true alternative to other cancer diagnostics. The news release makes a huge claim with its headline: “New blood test may transform the way cancer is monitored and treated.” It then doesn’t provide any evidence to support this claim. It could just as well have declared “new blood test may not transform the way cancer is monitored and treated.”","William Heisel,Andrae Vandross, MD,Joy Victory","We like that the cost issue is addressed. But the terms are vague. It says that the test is “relatively low cost.” Relative to what? To traditional “whole body imaging,” as the release notes above? Then provide some of those costs. It also says, “especially compared to next-generation DNA sequencing,” which costs how much? We were expecting a thorough explanation and some numbers that illustrate how this test could more regularly track the growth and spread of cancer cells. But there was no quantification in the release. There is no mention of harms. The assumption here is that more regular monitoring of patients via blood samples will lead to better outcomes, when we actually know from repeated studies that more monitoring for disorders leads to more unnecessary treatments and surgeries. What is the false positive rate? The false negative rate? What are the possible clinical harms that can result from either of these scenarios? The release does explain, after a very effusive quote about how broadly applicable this test may be, that the test was only examined in six patients who had only two types of cancers. Then it says, “the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients.” So the study was extremely limited in scope. The release would have been better to call out this caveat explicitly instead of leaving it up to the reader to figure out. Other releases we have seen say things like, “This study was only conducted in six patients and would need to be repeated with a much larger group in order to make strong claims about its broad efficacy in cancer diagnosis and monitoring.” There is no disease mongering in the release. Funders are noted in the sidebar where this release is hosted on EurekAlert! but not in the release itself. We encourage news release writers to include funders in the body of the release. There is no mention of conflicts of interest in the release, nor in the study itself. The release makes a glancing reference to “other methods.” It says, “The single-color digital PCR test offers several advantages over other methods of circulating tumor DNA analysis, compared to next-generation targeted sequencing and fluorescent probe-based digital PCR assays. The main advantage is that the new technique does not rely on pre-amplification, which can introduce errors and biases.” This is not an adequate comparison. It would have been helpful to mention specific blood tests for the tumor types looked at even in this small sample size–this would have given context and why this work is important. It is clear from the release that the test is not widely available and is only just now being developed. The release establishes novelty here: The test, which is called single color digital PCR, requires only a fraction of a tube of blood and can detect as few as three mutation-bearing molecules in a single reaction. We think that given the extremely small number of patients who even had test results that could be monitored for cancer growth — three people! — making broad claims about this being a low-cost alternative for all cancers is over the top. This is what the release says: “For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. Nearly all cancer patients require monitoring by whole body imaging, which can be costly, complex, and time-consuming. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread.” Does that sound like a test that was only used on six patients, only three of whom had detectable cancer?"," ",mixture,Elsevier

If soap and water are not accessible, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

2633,France's 20th century radium craze still haunts Paris.,"July 19, 2012","The Belle Epoque, France’s golden era at the turn of the last century, bequeathed Paris elegant landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, but also a more sinister legacy of radioactive floors and backyards which the capital is only now addressing.","Michel Rose, Marion Douet","When the Franco-Polish Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie discovered the radioactive element radium in 1898, she set off a craze for the luminescent metal among Parisians, who started using it for everything from alarm clock dials to lipsticks and even water fountains. The companies that manufactured these slightly radioactive objects have long gone out of business, but they left small doses of radium between the cracks of some Parisian parquet floors. These doses, after prolonged exposure, could prove toxic though, officials say, they do not pose serious health risks. “The history of radium started in Paris,” said Eric Lanes, head of radioactive decontamination at France’s national agency for radioactive waste, ANDRA. “Marie Curie never patented her discoveries so a lot of people rode the radium wave.”   After Curie showed that radium could be used to destroy cancerous cells, people assumed that the new element had miraculous healing properties and started putting it in everything from body lotions to cough syrups. “Cancerous cells are more sensitive to radiation than healthy ones. Curie understood that,” said Lanes. “But some people embarked on businesses more akin to charlatans’ tricks.”   Curie herself died at 66 from her prolonged, unprotected exposure to radium. ANDRA - in some case using addresses that were written on vintage advertising posters - has identified some 130 sites in France suspected of being at risk. Some 40 of them are set for decontamination, half of those in the Paris area. Lanes said the clean-up was being undertaken as a precautionary measure under a recent French law requiring that preventative steps be taken in a case of a suspected health risk even in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence. “We have never found any worrying situations,” Lanes said. “We’re talking about levels that are too small to create a health impact.”   In a two-storey detached house in the leafy suburb of Chaville, 12 km (7 miles) southwest of central Paris, masked men in white hazmat suits drilled holes in the wooden floors of what used to be an aircraft altimeter factory before World War Two. The factory workers used to color the dials with glow-in-the-dark paint made from radium powder and zinc sulphide. Their plight was reminiscent of the so-called Radium Girls in the United States who contracted radiation poisoning around 1917 from licking their paint-brushes to sharpen them. In Chaville, traces of paint are still present in the wooden floor, the house’s garden and basement. Though too small to present a risk, they still have to be collected in drums through air-locks and sent to ANDRA’s nuclear waste storage sites. The decontamination cost for a house like this is 260,000 euros ($318,200), Lanes said. The agency has a 4 million euro annual budget for decontamination on top of the government’s 12 million euro budget for its “radium plan”. The occupants, who declined to be interviewed because they feared the publicity could lower the property’s value, were temporarily rehoused at ANDRA’s expenses and will get the renovated house back after three months. Some sites deemed too contaminated to make a renovation cost-effective have been bought by ANDRA and razed. The Jersyk family’s former house in Gif-sur-Yvette, just south of Paris’ military airport of Villacoublay, is one of them. It was part of an estate built in the 1950s near a disused factory where radium needles for hospitals had been manufactured. “When the factory shut, the land was sold, the ground leveled, and they built houses on it, it was as simple as that. It’s monstrous,” said Eglet Jersyk, an 81-year-old pensioner. After spotting a news item in the local newspaper about the former factory’s radioactive legacy, she and her husband Christian joined a local group to demand government action. “No one told us anything when we bought it in 1966 but a lot of mystery surrounded that house. We were only told: ‘You shouldn’t grow vegetables in the garden’,” she said. Experts from France’s CEA atomic research agency came to visit the house in 1974 and found abnormal levels of radium and radon gas, she said, but it took some 30 years before the family could relocate to a nearby town. In the meantime, her husband, a do-it-yourself enthusiast who often worked in his basement, suffered from cough and heart problems which she said a doctor linked to radioactive fumes. Her complaint was dismissed by a court in the early 2000s, she said, and shortly after ANDRA offered to buy the house at market prices. ($1 = 0.8170 euros)"," ",true,Environment
9215,Researchers develop automated melanoma detector for skin cancer screening,"January 3, 2017","This news release reports on a study of a computerized technology that combines imaging with digital analysis to help improve the screening of melanoma skin lesions. The news release explains the specificity and sensitivity of the test. It also clearly discloses who funded the research. One downside is that it’s not until the final paragraph that we learn this is still experimental research that must be confirmed in larger studies. Earlier statements make it sound farther along, e.g., “researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.” A larger concern is how the release downplayed the high-false positive rate of 64%, saying this “approaches” the false-positive rate of manual detection by expert dermatologist, which studies put at about 32%. Melanoma can be very difficult to diagnose so if doctors could use a tool that helped better screen suspicious-looking moles, they might be able to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and save lives. This new approach thus far has shown promise, but further research will be needed to validate it as an enhanced diagnostic tool–and that should be made upfront and clear to the journalists and consumers who read the news release.","Alan Cassels,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Joy Victory","This technology seems to still be in the experimental stage. The news release reports a 98% sensitivity and 36% specificity for melanoma detection, which is a level that approaches that of an expert lesion diagnosis. But the release could have noted that this still isn’t very accurate: A 36% specificity means that 64% of those without melanoma will test positive (i.e. false positive). That translates to a lot of unnecessary anxiety and follow-up testing to rule out suspicious growths. The release says the test’s ability to diagnose normal moles was 36 percent, “approaching the levels achieved by expert dermatologists performing visual examinations of suspect moles under the microscope.” But as noted above, that statement downplays the fact that the test will result in a very high number of false-positives. A 36% specificity means that nearly two thirds of non-malignant moles will test positive and require additional follow-up. A test that correctly identifies nearly all melanomas, but also flags more than half of normal growths as melanomas, isn’t all that useful. The investigators note that this research needs to be confirmed with larger studies–but not until the end of the release. More should have been included on this point, and higher up, so as to not mislead readers into thinking this product is coming to market soon. And less needed to be said on the potential applications, which is still in “hearsay” phase considering the state of research. For example, this quote: “I think this technology could help detect the disease earlier, which could save lives, and avoid unnecessary biopsies too,” is premature. No obvious disease mongering is evident here. We are told that “this work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and in part by the Paul and Irma Milstein Family Foundation and the American Skin Association.” The release says “the ability of the test to correctly diagnose normal moles was 36 percent, approaching the levels achieved by expert dermatologists performing visual examinations of suspect moles under the microscope.” That differs from what’s in the study, which reports “the visual examination of pigmented lesions by expert dermatologists using dermoscopy and following criteria such as the Menzies (or CASH[3]) method has yielded diagnostic accuracy as high as 98% sensitivity and 68% specificity in some studies.” Sixty-eight percent specificity is much more accurate than 36%, so we’re not sure how that can be defined as “approaching the levels” of accuracy of visual exams by expert dermatologist. Some of the language used suggests the technology is mature, “Now, researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.” It is not until the final paragraph that the need for further research is noted. The release establishes that this is a potential new way to augment melanoma detection. The release does not use sensational language. However, we did want to highlight this quote, which was problematic: “The success of the Q-score in predicting melanoma is a marked improvement over competing technologies,” says Daniel Gareau, first author of the report and instructor in clinical investigation in the Krueger laboratory.” We think that it is a bit premature to be this definitive. A recent review of competing technologies suggests that confocal scanning laser microscopy has a sensitivity of 88-98% and a specificity of 83-99%.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.13250/full,mixture,"Melanoma,The Rockefeller University"
10213,New DNA Tests Aimed at Reducing Colon Cancer,"October 29, 2010","Strengths:  Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week. It was the only one of the four stories we reviewed on this topic that made this clear. Weaknesses: It didn’t provide a meaningful comparison of the new approaches with existing colon cancer screening tests. It also has problems with how the underlying question is presented. Two examples:  “The new tests could help most people avoid colonoscopies, which are routinely prescribed for people over age 50.” – perhaps implying to the reader that evidence supports a recommendation of colonoscopy for everyone.That is not the case; there are several potential screening tests available, including other stool tests – something not mentioned in the story. “Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.” This sentence has a lot of information, but is also somewhat misleading. Use of colonoscopy is actually pretty good, and most people who don’t have one have never been asked, calling into question that people “don’t want to have one.” The cost effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. other screening techniques is a complex question, but suffice it to say that the new technology being studied is not likely to be more cost-effective overall (previous stool DNA tests have performed much worse (higher costs, lower efficacy) than colonoscopy in modeling studies. This topic is really about when we should pay attention to evidence about a new diagnostic test and how we should evaluate diagnostic tests in comparison with one another- a topic that is often inadequately discussed in both medicine and journalism."," ","The story says, “Both tests would be less expensive than colonoscopy, and potentially more effective.”  No specific cost estimate is given. The Philadelphia Inquirer said “Though the cost has not been set, it could be as low as $300 per test.” Reuters reported that the company said earlier that it would aim for $300-400 per test. The story also states that “Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high” – implying that the new test might be more cost-effective. But it’s unclear at this point if that would be true. For example, previous stool DNA tests have performed much worse (higher costs, lower efficacy) than colonoscopy in modeling studies. The story did a decent job comparing data presented on two new competing tests. It does not, however, compare the benefits to existing colon cancer screening tests. We will dock points for this in our final criterion on “comparing the new approach with existing alternatives” but will give it the benefit of the doubt on this one. The two tests the Times reported on were done on blood and on stool, which, in theory, should not harm anyone during the screening. But there is potential for harms as a result of screening. The story states that with the Exact Sciences DNA test “12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm.”  And, regarding the Epigenomics blood test, the story states that “more false positives could be generated so you could end up doing more harm than good.” Mixed bag. The story did provide some important context about test. For example, it says, “Exact Sciences reported in July that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.” But only in passing does it mention that “in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples.”  It could/should have driven home the point more clearly that the methodology used in the study tends to overestimate performance compared with an evaluation done in a representative sample population (hence the need to do another study). WebMD, for example, did a better job on this point, with a quote from Dr. Durado Brooks of the American Cancer Society: “This was a very preliminary study that utilized samples from individuals who were known to have colon polyps or cancer. The performance may decrease considerably when the test is used in a large population of healthy individuals.” Health Day quoted Brooks: “Showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward.” There was also no discussion of the limitations of drawing conclusions from an abstract presented at a scientific conference – something that has not yet undergone the kind of peer review that a journal would use. No disease mongering. This story relies too heavily on researchers who are connected to the companies developing the cancer screens. Where was the truly independent perspective? As noted in the “benefits” criterion above, this story did not even discuss other stool tests like fecal immunochemical testing or other fecal occult blood tests that are currently available and have been shown to perform well in appropriate samples. It did a decent job in comparing two new technologies, but got hung up on this comparison while forgetting existing tests. In so doing, the end of the story devolves a bit into a “my product is better than your product” tit for tat. Which is what can happen when your only quoted sources all have connections to the companies involved. Although the story doesn’t discuss existing stool tests like fecal immunochemical testing or other fecal occult blood testing, on the issue of relative novelty, the story scores points for being the only we reviewed that mentioned that the Exact Sciences DNA test is only one of two leading technologies being developed right now. This story did not rely on a news release."," ",mixture,"Cancer,New York Times"
17053,"President Barack Obama’s budget threatens national security by proposing ""an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor.","May 4, 2014","Sensenbrenner said that President Obama’s budget proposed ""an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor."" The congressman doesn’t read as much into the numbers as did Romney. But he flubbed the historical comparison pointed out by others, and experts say it’s a limited and potentially misleading comparison in any event.",Dave Umhoefer,"Near the end of an April 15, 2014 town hall meeting in his district, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner listened to a constituent cite something on the Internet about the resignation of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""There’s no truth meter on the Internet,"" remarked Sensenbrenner, a Republican elected to Congress in southeastern Wisconsin since 1978. Respectfully, we beg to differ on that. A remark earlier in the town-hall session by Sensenbrenner about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s plans to downsize the Army’s troop strength caught our attention. ""With respect to the president’s budget proposal, there the recommendation was that we have an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor,"" Sensenbrenner said when asked about survivor’s benefits. ""That’s ridiculous and outrageous."" Let’s put that one on our Truth-O-Meter. When we asked Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller for backup on the historical comparison, he referred us to the U.S. Department of Defense’s budget request for fiscal year 2015. It quoted the Quadrennial Defense Review 2014. That five-year plan says the active Army will reduce its ""end strength"" to between 440,000 and 450,000 personnel. The current active-duty figure is about 520,000, Army spokesman Troy Rolan told us. Miller also pointed to stories in the New York Times, and a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that included Associated Press reporting on Hagel’s budget. The Times piece said that ""cuts proposed by the Obama administration would result in the smallest Army since just before the World War II buildup."" The AP report said the active-duty Army would shrink to the ""smallest number since 1940, when the nation was gearing up to enter World War II."" But Sensenbrenner didn’t say Hagel’s plan would result in the smallest Army since before the war buildup. He said it would be smaller than the pre-war troop complement. Before the U.S. buildup got cranked up, the Army had 188,000 troops in mid-1939 and 264,000 in mid-1940, official Army figures show. So Hagel’s plan for 440,000 active troops would still be larger than that, contrary to what Sensenbrenner said. Sensenbrenner’s phrasing looks better if you limit the comparison just to the 1941 period right before Pearl Harbor. But the troop numbers from 1941 include the U.S. buildup that began in 1940 in the wake of Germany’s 1939 invasion of Poland. By late August 1941, active-duty Army personnel totalled about 1.6 million. If Sensenbrenner was using 1.6 million as his comparison point, he couldn’t confine his outrage to the Obama/Hagel Army of 450,000, because every Army since 1952 has been smaller than 1.6 million. Troop levels ebb and flow, as you might expect, around major wars. After the World War II peak of 8.3 million, the Army’s numbers fell dramatically, then blipped up to 1.6 million during the Korean War. After another drop, the number ramped up to 1.475 million during the Vietnam War before levelling off at about 775,000 from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. The Army’s size fell significantly throughout the 1990s to 479,000 before slowly ticking up to 571,000 after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As America has drawn down troops in those nations, the Army’s strength has dropped to the current 520,000. So, with the proposed reduction, the Army would be just below where it was before the Sept. 11 attacks. Strained comparison There’s another angle to consider here: the difficulty in comparing a 1940 Army to today’s model. We asked military historian Lance Janda of Cameron University in Oklahoma to assess Sensenbrenner’s comments. Janda called the comments ""terribly misleading, implying as they do a sort of similarity between the technology, force structure, threat environment, and federal budget reality in 2014 and the one in 1940 that simply does not exist."" In terms of weapons systems, communications capabilities, speed of deployment, radius of action, and overall destructive potential, Janda said, the U.S. is light years beyond where it was prior to World War II. ""In 1940 our Army and army Air Corps were relatively small and our Navy was one among several powerful navies around the world,"" Janda said. ""Today, the United States Navy and Air Force have no peers."" Travis Sharp, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonprofit think tank, wrote that size of the force often does matter, but ""since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment, comparing them does not help us decide what to do today."" ""While interesting,"" Sharp wrote, ""the comparison to 1940 is not particularly useful."" ""Today's Army is vastly more capable, even at a fraction of the headcount,"" John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, told us. Hagel, in announcing the budget reductions in February 2014, called them difficult and not without added risk. Hagel said the cuts assume the United States no longer becomes involved in large, prolonged stability operations overseas on the scale of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Defense Department reported. But he said the smaller force still would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major war ""while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary."" Still, some analysts, including Sharp, have expressed concerns about repercussions on the battlefield and beyond if the active-duty complement falls to 440,000 without appropriate contingency planning. ""Prioritizing technology over size has a strategic logic and conforms with historical practice,"" wrote Sharp. ""Despite this logic, focusing on high-tech modernization without simultaneously implementing policies to regenerate ground forces quickly should a crisis erupt constitutes strategic negligence of the highest order."" PolitiFact National checked a statement similar to Sensenbrenner’s in January 2012. The speaker was Mitt Romney. The Republican presidential candidate said that the U.S. military is at risk of losing its ""military superiority"" because ""our Navy is smaller than it’s been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."" The claim earned a  rating. The numbers were close to accurate, but experts said it was wrong to assume a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. And the comparison of today’s military to its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 was deemed ridiculous. Our rating Sensenbrenner said that President Obama’s budget proposed ""an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor.""

2839,Increasing H7N9 bird flu toll demands constant vigilance.,"January 17, 2014",A wave of H7N9 bird flu cases and deaths in China since the start of 2014 shows emerging flu strains need constant surveillance if the world is not to be caught off guard by a deadly pandemic.,"Kate Kelland, Health, Science Correspondent","At least 24 H7N9 flu infections and three deaths have been confirmed in the past week by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a big increase on the two cases and one death reported for the four-month period of June to September. China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Friday it had seen 28 confirmed human cases of H7N9 in five provinces across the country since the start of the year. “There’s now a clear second wave of this virus,” said Jake Dunning, a researcher at Imperial College London who has been monitoring the outbreak. While the winter flu season means an increase in infections is not unexpected, it raises the risk of the virus mutating and perhaps getting a chance to acquire genetic changes that may allow it to spread easily from one person to another. The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 170 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing around 50 of them. Many, but not all, of those infected had contact with poultry or other birds, so for now this virus has apparently not adapted to easy human-to-human transmission - one of the main features keeping a pandemic emergency response on hold. China’s health commission said experts had concluded that H7N9 transmission “is still from poultry to humans”. Yet the strain does have some worrying features, including a limited capability to spread from one person to another. Several clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China. An analysis of probable H7N9 transmission from person to person, published last August, gave the best proof yet that it can sporadically jump between people. A separate team of researchers in the United States said in December while it is not impossible that H7N9 could become easily transmissible from person to person, it would need to undergo multiple mutations. Another alarm was sounded last month when scientists said they had found that a mutation in the virus can render it resistant to a first-line treatment drug without limiting its ability to spread in mammals. WHO chief spokesman Gregory Hartl said the United Nations health agency had noted the rapid increase in infections in the past few weeks and was keeping a watchful eye. “So far we haven’t seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,” he said from WHO’s Geneva headquarters  The WHO’s stance, based on its December 20 assessment, is that five small family clusters have been reported but “evidence does not currently support sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus. The current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.”  That was echoed by the Chinese health commission, which said: “Up to now, inspections have found no mutations of the virus that are of significance to public health”. Flu viruses, however, often put on their biggest show of strength in the northern hemisphere’s cold winter months of January and February. And with more of the virus circulating in wild birds, poultry and in the larger numbers of people infected, the new strain has more opportunity to adapt and mix with other strains that may give it pandemic potential. Peter Openshaw, director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said the rising toll of infections and deaths is “a signal for concern” because “historically what has happened in major outbreaks is there are occasional, sporadic cases and then it starts to build”. “But whether it means that there is any change in the virus’ behavior is another important question. If it were changing the way it is behaving, that would be more alarming,” he said. Early gene analysis work on the emerging H7N9 virus in April last year found it had been circulating widely but went undetected and had acquired significant genetic diversity. Scientists warned then that its genetic diversity showed the H7N9 virus has an ability to mutate repeatedly and was likely to continue doing so. Hartl said: “Mutations happen all the time. While yes, the more virus there is, the more mutations could happen, it is also true that almost all of these mutations are benign.”"," ",true,Health News
10053,"Good news, bad news for former estrogen users","April 5, 2011","In its brevity, this piece lacks that all-important context that more expert comment might have provided. In addition, it fails to answer key questions that any reader will ask:  DOES THIS APPLY TO ME? The story does not emphasize clearly enough the fact that this study concerned estrogen ALONE, vs estrogen plus progestin in combination. So women who took estrogen with progestin may think the results apply to them. Not until the last line is this crucial difference addressed. Also, if there were risks or benefits, how big are they? There is no quantitative, and little qualitative information about the size of benefits and risks. In addition, some of the statements are misleading – see details below. Millions of women have already taken hormone replacement, and more are poised in the delicate transition where such therapy may be considered. The medical confusion is tricky for them, and this story will be widely read. Giving a true picture of this confusion is vital to helping women maneuver among unknowns."," ","The story didn’t quantify the benefits. The competing NY Times did a somewhat better job, although it got an unsatisfactory score as well. The Post tries but fails to do justice to the mixed picture of longer-term outcomes for women who took estrogen-only therapy. There is no quantitative statement about the risks, or the benefits. Some of the findings are misstated: “Risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while women were taking the hormone.” The point of the study is that there was no increased risk in heart disease in estrogen-alone users (as opposed to findings with estrogen/progestin arm); and longer followup confirmed no increase. As stated, the story seems to imply there was an increased risk for heart disease that did not diminish during followup. This story didn’t do as good a job as the competing NY Times did on this criterion. While the Post mentioned an accompanying editorial, it didn’t emphasize some expert skepticism. The expert comments in the Times piece were more clear and concise in their questioning of the relative relevance and importance of the evidence. For example, the Times reported:   This short story avoids mongering, although our medical editor on this review thought the tone hypes the dangers of estrogen when the data show that the risks, though real, are small in absolute terms. We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt here, as it at least cited an accompanying editorial – although, as noted in the “evidence” criterion above, the NY Times did a better job in eliciting clear quotes about context from its sources. Although not as thorough as the NY Times on this point, the story at least stated:"," ",mixture,"Washington Post,women's health"
7180,Baltimore mayor says her $500K book deal was a ‘mistake’.,,Baltimore’s mayor on Thursday described a lucrative arrangement to sell her self-published children’s books to a university-based health care system as a “regrettable mistake” and offered apologies for “any lack of confidence or disappointment” citizens and colleagues may be feeling.," David Mcfadden","At a City Hall news conference, Mayor Catherine Pugh provided five pages of paperwork, asserting they detail production and various deliveries of her “Healthy Holly” books to Baltimore’s school system. She also provided a copy of a January 2011 letter to the district’s chief academic officer describing a donation of 20,000 copies of “Health Holly: Exercising is Fun!” Since 2011, Pugh received $500,000 selling her illustrated paperback series to the University of Maryland Medical System, a $4 billion hospital network. Pugh sat on the medical system’s board of directors for about 18 years. “I am deeply sorry for any lack of confidence or disappointment which this initiative may have caused any Baltimore City residents and colleagues. In hindsight, this arrangement with the University of Maryland Medical System was a regrettable mistake,” she said, speaking in a weakened voice as she recovers from what spokespeople called a bout of pneumonia. One of Maryland’s largest private employers, the UMMS paid Pugh half-a-million dollars for 100,000 copies of her roughly 20-page books, arguably making her among the world’s most successful self-published authors. There was no contract behind the deal and the hospital network described some of the purchases as “grants” in federal filings. Pugh — who once sat on a state Senate committee that funded the major health network before becoming mayor in 2016 — served on the system’s board since 2001. Pugh’s slim “Healthy Holly” books, sharing tips on nutrition and exercise, were meant to be distributed to schools and daycares. But the school district has described her hard-to-find books as “unsolicited” donations after The Baltimore Sun recently exposed Pugh’s arrangements with UMMS. Fewer than 9,000 copies were found collecting dust in a district warehouse. It’s unclear where tens of thousands of other copies are. Pugh suggested Thursday that it was up to the city’s school district to clear up the confusion. “I do hope that we find out from the school system where the rest of those books are,” she said. During the evening press conference, Pugh also held up cloth bibs, onesies and other baby items with words like “jump” and “play” emblazoned on them that she says were intended to be part of her campaign to teach youngsters and families about health. She said her “Healthy Holly” initiative was “never about books” but was “about a lifestyle.” She said her lawyer advised her not to take any questions since the arrangement with UMMS is now being investigated. A retired state corruption investigator has filed a complaint against Pugh with the state prosecutor’s office. Pugh choked up at the end of her presentation and departed the conference room, appearing drained as reporters yelled out questions. A Democrat, Pugh faces a 2020 Democratic primary for re-election in a city dominated by her party’s political machine. Criticism of UMMS and of Pugh has lately been intense. The Washington Post’s editorial board recently asserted the UMMS had a “get-rich-quick program” for many of its board members, with Pugh’s involvement painted as an egregious case of “political sleaze.” In recent days, Pugh resigned from the volunteer UMMS board and returned her most recent payment of $100,000. She also amended years of financial disclosure forms from her state Senate days. Pugh is not the only board member who received significant financial compensation from UMMS. About one-third of the UMMS board members received compensation through the medical system’s arrangements with their businesses, a revelation that Gov. Larry Hogan has called “appalling.” Two other members of the board have also resigned, and four others went on voluntary leave while the system reviews governance practices. The president and CEO of the University of Maryland Medical System has recently been sent on a temporary leave of absence. Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot says an independent audit is urgent to understand how many “self-dealing” arrangements there have been over the years. ___ Follow McFadden on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dmcfadd",https://twitter.com/dmcfadd,true,"Health, Childrens books, University of Maryland, Catherine Pugh, Maryland, U.S. News, Baltimore"
26611,"Chain message Says ""special military helicopters will spray pesticide against the Corona virus in the skies all over the country.","March 24, 2020",There is no evidence the United States military is using helicopters to spray pesticide in an effort to kill the coronavirus.,Daniel Funke,"Not even neighborhood social networking apps are safe from misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent post on Neighbors, an app created by Ring — the company that makes video doorbells — claims that the United States military is using helicopters to ""spray pesticide against the Corona virus in the skies all over the country."" A map on the post indicates that the user shared it in San Diego. ""So you must stay indoors after twelve o’clock at night and remove all clothes which are outside,"" the post reads. ""When you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19)."" A reader sent us a screenshot of the post, which was subsequently shared on Snapchat, on March 23. The text of the post has also been shared on Facebook. (Screenshot from Snapchat) We’ve seen several other chain messages that make  claims about the military’s actions against the coronavirus, so we decided to check this one out, too. There is no evidence that the U.S. military is using helicopters to spray coronavirus-killing pesticide on American communities. A similar hoax has been passed around in Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Egypt, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates. On March 22, President Donald Trump said during a press briefing that the federal government is deploying additional National Guard assistance to New York, California and Washington to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. During the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said the government is also working with the military to charter flights for Americans abroad. Meanwhile, Navy ships have been sent to New York and California to provide additional health care support. The Army Corps of Engineers is building more medical facilities. And, according to the Military Times, more than 8,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized in all 50 states. That’s a significant activation of the military within U.S. borders, but it’s a far cry from using helicopters to spray pesticides on cities across the country. In September, Rhode Island officials approved aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, which had caused an outbreak of the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. Other states have taken similar actions, and the U.S. Air Force Reserve has an aerial spray program. But those efforts are aimed at limiting the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves. And while Chinese officials have used drones to disinfect surfaces potentially tainted by the coronavirus, experts told us there is no evidence that spraying pesticide from a helicopter would kill the virus on the ground in the U.S. ""That idea is pretty far-fetched,"" said Murray Isman, dean emeritus of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, in an email. ""There are no pesticides that specifically target viruses, and general antimicrobials that might have any effect (bleach, alcohol) would have to be applied in ridiculously high volumes."" According to the Environmental Protection Agency, disinfectants qualify as ""antimicrobial pesticides"" since they are used to kill bacteria and viruses.

35554,Legionnaires' disease can be contracted from a face mask used repeatedly.,"August 6, 2020","In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance for reopening buildings after widespread and abrupt COVID-19 shutdowns of businesses, schools, and other facilities. Those closures resulted in decreased water usage, which could contribute to pooling in water systems that are prime locations for the growth of Legionella bacterium. Combined with shutdown-related declines in water chlorination and regular cleaning, the agency noted that the bacteria may accumulate in standing water over the course of weeks or months before being aerosolized through devices like showers, hot tubs, fountains, and air conditioning cooling towers used once localities reopen.",Madison Dapcevich,"A series of social media posts widely circulated in August 2020 claimed that Legionnaires’ disease, a respiratory infection that can cause a rare and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia, could be contracted from reused face masks worn to protect against COVID-19. Snopes readers asked us to verify this rumor that essentially argues respiratory droplets containing Legionella pneumophila, the pathogen that causes Legionnaires’ disease, may persist in those contaminated respiratory droplets held within a used mask. Specifically, the social media posts stated that the “moisture and bacteria” found in an anonymous woman’s mask, which she wore daily, resulted in a misdiagnosis of COVID-19. Mask wearers beware … A caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these “spikes” in COVID are really something else due to improper mask wearing?? Copied and pasted The claim in the social media post is false. According to Legionella, a nonprofit organization that shares educational material and scientific research about the disease, Legionnaires’ is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by infected persons or their masks. “You cannot contract Legionnaires’ disease from wearing face masks. Legionella bacterium is transmitted by aspirating drinking water or breathing in water droplets. Legionella is not spread from person-to-person in respiratory droplets nor does the bacteria survive on dry surfaces. Your mask would not be a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria,” wrote the organization on its website. Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of lung infection caused by breathing in mist or water that is contaminated with the bacterium. The condition is characterized by a cough, fever, headache, and shortness of breath — all symptoms that are also associated with COVID-19 and could potentially result in the misdiagnosis. Though Legionnaires’ is treatable with antibiotics, about 1-in-10 infected people will die. However, as noted by Legionella, if a person were diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, it would not be a consequence of wearing a mask. Water contaminated with the bacteria must be directly inhaled or drank by an individual in order to become infected. As such, a mask would theoretically need to come into direct contact with contaminated water in order for it to be inhaled. Even so, Legionella only grows in standing water under warm temperatures and cannot survive on dry surfaces."," ",false,"Medical, COVID-19"
31114,Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements warning that the music industry is run by pedophiles.,"August 7, 2017","We reached out to representatives of Justin Bieber and Kate Perry for comment, but did not hear back before publication time.",David Emery,"In early August 2017, articles appeared on unreliable web sites reporting that two of the most popular entertainers in pop music, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, had made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles. (Note: We recognize that pedophilia, which is defined as a sexual attraction to children, is not the same as child sexual abuse, although the web sites under discussion do not observe that distinction.) A YourNewsWire story written by Dmitry Baxter (one of the promulgators of the thoroughly discredited “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory claiming in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and other “Washington elites” ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capitol) intimated that the reason Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour in July was his realization that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business:  Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people — pedophiles.” Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour. Describing a party on tour — attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers — Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite. One day later, a similar article about Katy Perry was posted on the web site Neon Nettle (another hardcore purveyor of “Pizzagate” rumors, not to mention articles falsely attributing statements about show business pedophilia to actor Brad Pitt and implying connections between the deaths of alt-rockers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington and music industry child abusers): In a shocking exposé from one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Katy Perry has dealt a devastating blow to the entertainment world elite by revealing that the entire industry is “controlled” by “sick pedophiles”. The “I Kissed a Girl” singer had left many concerned about her mental state following a series of public breakdowns earlier this year. She made headlines when she disclosed her suicidal tendencies and exhibited signs of a split personality disorder, saying “I don’t want to be Katy Perry anymore”. The article goes on to paint a picture virtually identical to that in the YourNewsWire article of industry pedophiles making up an “exclusive club”:  Clearly troubled by the details, she told a group of close friends: “I can’t live this life any longer. They’re all pedophiles. What they do to these children is sick.” She continues to elaborate, visibly traumatized by the things she’s witnessed: “And they’re every where you go. It’s like they’re not even trying to hide it. They flaunt it like it’s a badge of honor” “The producers, the executives, the big names… They’re all in on it” “It’s like an exclusive club that you can only join if you do these evil things to innocent children… And it’s not just dirty old men, it’s all of them. Even the women.” “They say to me, ‘Katy, you need to take the next step in your career’, but there’s no way I would do those things to kids.” Despite the fact that both stories include elements of truth to shore up their credibility — Justin Bieber did cancel part of his 2017 tour, for example, and Katy Perry did say in a live-streamed therapy session that she doesn’t want to be “Katy Perry” anymore (i.e., in the sense of having to live up to fans’ expectations) — in neither case are the statements attributed to them about pedophilia sufficiently sourced or corroborated to earn readers’ credence. No such statements by Bieber and Perry have been quoted (or even mentioned) by any mainstream news outlets. On the contrary, these statements are lurid fabrications designed either to garner social media likes and shares (and advertising dollars), or spread disinformation intended to harm the reputations of so-called “Hollywood elites” (a favorite political target of both YourNewsWire and Neon Nettle), or both. Unfortunately, by disseminating these false stories, the web sites dilute and lend confusion to the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by the likes of former child actors Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood, who have separately gone on record saying the extent to which the sexual abuse of minors occurs in Hollywood is underreported. Worse, child abuse is one of those emotion-laden topics that can lead to violence, so there’s no room for false reporting. One would hope that lessons were learned from the Pizzagate debacle, which resulted in a credulous fake news reader firing an AR-15 rifle inside Washington DC’s Comet Ping Pong, a family restaurant; the shooter said he expected to rescue “child sex slaves” from a pedophile ring that does not exist, which was purportedly run out of the restaurant’s basement, which also does not exist."," ",false,"Entertainment, conspiracy theories, fake news, justin bieber"

This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State,” Trump wrote on May 20, 2020. “I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”The allegation was quickly refuted by Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson.“We sent applications, not ballots,” she replied. “Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia.”Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy— Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020Not only was Trump lying about Benson’s office sending “absentee ballots,” in reality the “7.7 million people” he referenced represents the total number of registered voters in the state. As the Detroit Free Press reported, receiving an application for an absentee ballot does not automatically mean one will be issued; the application would still need to be filled out and returned to the recipient’s local clerk’s office either physically or via regular or e-mail. If the recipient’s signature on the application matches the one in their existing voter records, they are then issued a ballot.According to Benson, the move to expand opportunities for casting an absentee ballot followed an uptick in voter turnout via mail on May 5 2020, when fifty local elections were held throughout the state amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed 4,915 residents since March 2020.“By mailing applications we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Benson said. She also correctly stated that Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska, and West Virginia — all states with Republicans holding her position — sent absentee ballot request forms available to their respective electorates.Trump’s threat to “hold up funding” against the state is his latest swipe at Democratic officials in Michigan, such as Benson and Gov.

4634,Indiana veteran who wanted final flight dies after reunion.,,"A Vietnam War veteran from western Indiana had his last wish fulfilled by his reunited Army comrades, who flew in the Terre Haute Air Show."," ","Ken Dierdorf died this week, just days after his debilitating illness prevented him from flying in a military helicopter with the men who fought alongside him, the Tribune-Star reported . He was 68. Dierdorf’s health had been in steady decline since 2010 when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, which attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body. The illness, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, led Dierdorf to eventually require a full-time respirator to aid his breathing. The Dierdorfs reached out to the Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice of the Wabash Valley earlier this year to see if they could get a Bell UH-1 Iroquois “Huey” ride for the Dirty Half Dozen, a group of Vietnam War veterans comprised of Dierdorf and his friends. VNA Hospice Care arranged a flight with the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation’s Huey at the air show. Even though Dierdorf couldn’t ride in the Huey last weekend, reuniting with his fellow military friends and watching them experience the flight fulfilled his last wish, said Kim Dierdorf, Ken’s wife. “He talked about it nonstop since Saturday,” she said. “And even though I know it took a lot out of him, I think because it was his last hurrah that he really, really wanted to do, I think that once that was able to happen for him he knew he didn’t have to fight any longer.” Ken Dierdorf getting his last wish fulfilled is fitting for someone so kind and full of life, said Gil Edgington, one of the Dirty Half Dozen friends. “It was all in God’s plan,” said Edgington, 69. “It meant so much to us, in his passing, that while it’s a shock we know that he’s not suffering anymore.” ___ Information from: Tribune-Star, http://www.tribstar.com","http://www.tribstar.com,http://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/veteran-who-wanted-final-flight-dies-after-reunion-with-army/article_d2276f8a-2e6d-5ed2-87f4-32371f127fba.html",true,"Health, Lou Gehrigs disease, Terre Haute, Air shows, Indiana, Veterans"
3652,"Pakistan battles dengue epidemic, with 20 deaths so far.",,"Pakistani health officials were battling an outbreak of dengue fever in the South Asian nation on Tuesday, a day after health officials confirmed over 10,000 cases and 20 deaths in recent months."," Munir Ahmed","More patients with symptoms of dengue fever were arriving at hospitals in all major cities, including the capital Islamabad, putting a strain on the country’s poor health system. Health officials hope that the anti-mosquito spraying in urban areas targeting stagnant water will help contain the disease. According to Zafar Mirza, a government adviser on health, as many as 10,013 dengue cases had so far been reported. Free medical treatment will be provided to patients suffering from the illness, he said. He said the number of dengue patients was still low as compared to previous years. Health officials are keeping dengue patients in isolated wards in hospitals across the country. Pakistan’s opposition criticized the government for not taking adequate measures to prevent the alarming outbreak of the disease. “The cases of dengue fever are increasing because of government’s incompetence,” said Maryam Aurangzeb, spokeswoman for the opposition Pakistan Muslim League party. Rafique Ahmed, a medical doctor at a government hospital in the city of Rawalpindi, said more than 150 patients suffering from dengue fever were being treated at their hospital, but “hopefully we will overcome this epidemic.” He said people with symptoms of a simple fever also rush to hospitals in a panic, fearing they had dengue fever. The mosquito-borne viral infection kills dozens of people every year in Pakistan. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash, and can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure in severe cases. So far 2,363 cases were reported in the eastern Punjab province, 2,258 in the southern Sindh province, 1,814 in the country’s northwest and 1,772 in southwestern Baluchistan province, Mirza said."," ",true,"Pakistan, Dengue fever, Health, Islamabad, General News, Asia, Epidemics, South Asia, Asia Pacific"
8240,UK trials new breathing aid developed by Mercedes Formula One.,"March 30, 2020","A new version of a breathing aid that can help coronavirus patients has been developed in less a week by a team involving Mercedes Formula One, and is being trialed at London hospitals."," ","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices have been used in China and Italy to deliver air and oxygen under pressure to patients’ lungs to help them breathe without the need for them to go on a ventilator, a more invasive process. The new CPAP has already been approved by the relevant regulator and now 100 of the machines will be delivered to University College London Hospital for trials, before being rolled out to other hospitals. Reports from Italy indicate that approximately 50% of patients given CPAP have avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, which involves patients being sedated, freeing up ventilators for those more in need. “These devices will help to save lives by ensuring that ventilators, a limited resource, are used only for the most severely ill,” UCLH critical care consultant Professor Mervyn Singer said in a statement on Monday. “We hope they will make a real difference to hospitals across the UK by reducing demand on intensive care staff and beds, as well as helping patients recover without the need for more invasive ventilation.”  The new breathing aid was developed by engineers and clinicians at UCLH teaming up with Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains who worked at UCL’s MechSpace hub to reverse engineer a device that can be produced quickly. Asked about the risk to healthcare workers of using CPAPs as contaminated droplets can escape from the device, Professor Rebecca Shipley, Director of UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering, told the BBC, that the risks were very low if those workers wore appropriate personal protective equipment. She also said that the new device could be scaled up very quickly. “Mercedes can make 1,000 a day within a week, and if the tests go well they can be in the NHS by the end of this week,” Shipley told BBC radio. Development of the new device took fewer than 100 hours from initial meeting to production of the first one. The team working on it also includes Oxford Optronix, a small company that will manufacture the oxygen monitors for the CPAP devices. Britain announced separately on Monday that it has placed an order for 10,000 ventilators to be made by a consortium of companies including Ford (F.N), Airbus (AIR.PA) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) as part of efforts to fight the coronavirus, an industry source told Reuters.","uk.reuters.com/companies/RR.L,uk.reuters.com/companies/F.N,uk.reuters.com/companies/AIR.PA",true,Health News
10562,The trouble with mammograms,"August 17, 2009","The idea that screening may be harmful is not often discussed in news stories. The story nicely presents this seemingly counter-intuitive point that finding more cancer may not save lives; however, the story could have discussed the role patients can play in deciding whether or not to get screened and how they could discuss this decision with physicians, who may be strong advocates for screening. The story does not mention that women could discuss an individualized screening schedule with their physician. Some women at higher-risk of breast cancer may be better candidates for annual screening between age 40-50 (or earlier, depending on family history or genetic markers), while others may not wish to screen until they are in their 50s or 60s. The story does not mention how physicians could counsel anxious patients on the true value of screening for breast cancer. The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the cost implications for such treatments are not discussed, an important omission at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story superbly cites expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm, women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer."," ","The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the story does not address the cost implications for such treatments–around $10 billion annually for screening and another $10 billion annually on treatment– an important point at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story does a nice job presenting the number needed to test or NNT (how many women screened regularly would save one life) and NNH (how many women screened who would receive unnecessary treatments). These are important numbers that are typically missing in health news stories. The story also notes other evidence that 22% of cancers might regress on their own. This is another important point that women may wish to consider as they plan a personal mammography screening schedule, or if they choose not to screen for breast cancer. The story describes the discomfort of mammography and the potential harms of screening, i.e. finding benign lesions and overtreatment for a less agressive cancer. The story does not mention the anxiety many women face both before and post-screening, especially if a mammogram is positive. The false positive rate of mammography is about 50% over 10 years (~with 10 mammograms likely to get one false positive). The story does an excellent job explaining the BMJ study design and evidence from a recent Cochrane review of breast cancer screening. This new information is presented in the context of similar analyses that also found screening was overvalued for saving lives. The story does not engage in disease mongering. Instead, the story discusses lower-risk forms of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions that may not need to be treated. The story does a superb job here. There are expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm,  women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer. The story raises the clear option that some women may choose not to have regular mammograms – an option not often discussed in news stories. The long-time availability of mammograms is evident in the story. With the exception of certain lower socio-economic communities and geographic areas, mammograms are increasingly available to women as a result of well-funded public health campaigns and messages that more screening will save lives. The story focuses not on availability, but on a recently published article which adds evidence to previous meta-analyses that mammograms may be oversold for saving lives. The idea that screening may be harmful is new in the popular press. The story does a nice job presenting this seemingly counter-intuitive point that finding more cancer may not save lives; however, the story could have discussed the role patients can play in deciding whether or not to get screened and the role of shared decision-making between patients and caregivers. The story does not appear to rely on a press release for information. There is a good deal of interpretation of medical studies and independent reporting from a range of clinical experts and breast cancer advocacy groups."," ",true," "
2493,Bike sharing offers big fitness benefits for the little commute.,"June 24, 2013","With bike sharing plans rolling on asphalt from New York City to Budapest, experts say city streets are becoming as fitness-friendly as country trails.",Dorene Internicola,"Even short cycling jaunts can make a difference in the health of city dwellers. “If you were driving a car and switched to biking, that 10 minutes going and coming a day would be a big deal,” said Dr. Robert Oppliger, an exercise physiologist with the American College of Sports Medicine. Oppliger, an avid cyclist, said even a two-to-three-mile (3.2-to-4.8-km) spin can yield significant health benefits. “There’s a lot of information coming out on something called active transport that compares traveling by bike or public transit to traveling by car,” he said. “The benefits are significant the more mobile you are.”  Government guidelines recommend adults accumulate 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week. Cycling, he said, can be part of that. “Bicycling has positive effects on weight and cardio- vascular health,” he said. “Even a couple of times a week is beneficial in terms of all the problems with obesity.”  Last week the American Medical Association designated obesity, which affects one third of U.S. adults, a disease. Not all cities can accommodate bike share programs, which are not designed for avid cyclists, said Oppliger. He said his hometown of Iowa City, a relatively small community with short commuting distances, is unsuited for such a program. In New York City, which kicked off a massive bike sharing program this spring, 56 percent of auto trips are under three miles, according to the New York City Department of Transportation website. “For two to three miles it’s a pretty good way to get around,” said Oppliger, who also praised the city for adding 200 bike lane miles in the past three years alone. “New York City has done a pretty good job of preparing the area and now it’s starting to pay off,” he added. Bicycling magazine’s Editor-in-Chief Peter Flax predicts that 10 years from now the decision to introduce bike sharing to New York City will have seemed obvious. “Maybe more than any other American city, New York is perfectly suited to bike share,” said Flax. “It’s relatively flat and efficient to get around.”  Flax has sampled similar programs in Washington, D.C., Paris and Barcelona. He readily admits, after watching a parade of New York’s big blue bikes riding against the traffic on a one-way street, that the biggest, most ambitious bike share program in North America is in for a period of adjustment. “We’re 25 to 30 years behind Europe,” he said. “Our cycling community needs to embrace the rules of the road.”  He foresees attitudes changing as the bikes blend into street life. “In five years it won’t be a problem,” he predicts. “Taxi drivers are already changing their behavior. The last thing they want is to have an accident with someone on a city bike.”  Dani Simons of NYC Bike Share, which controls day-to-day operations, said the goal was simply to make it easier for New Yorkers to get around their city. So far more 44,780 people have signed up for annual membership in the New York program, which is similar in concept to bike shares in Paris, London and Boston, the website Citibikenyc.com. “We are really, really pleased,” said Simons, adding email requests are flooding in from New Yorkers who live in parts of the city not served by the program. New York-based fitness expert Liz Neporent, author of “Fitness for Dummies,” applauds the program. “The bikes are getting used a lot. I’m all for anything that gets people moving,” she said, adding that cycling gets hearts and lungs into shape and exercises muscles without stressing the joints. “Every little bit adds up,” she said. “Riding a bike beats grabbing a cab or sitting your butt down in the subway.”"," ",true,Health News
2661,"Pop culture, wealthy Chinese spur medical tourism in Asia.","October 4, 2011",It is one of Asia’s fastest growing industries and shows no signs of losing steam even as the global economy wobbles.,Jeremy Laurence,"A plastic surgeon (L) speaks to his patient who travelled from Australia to Seoul to get liposuction at the BK DongYang Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul October 4, 2011. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won Traveling abroad for medical treatment is now a multi-billion dollar business. From a nip-and-tuck to a heart bypass, hospitals from India to Singapore and South Korea treat more than 1 million foreign patients a year — lured by cut-price surgery, no waiting lists, cutting-edge technology, and highly trained doctors. Industry experts predict medical tourism in Asia will grow at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year, mainly due to the emergence of nouveaux riches in the region. “Asian medical tourism ... seems to be increasing as affluence and mobility increase in Asia,” said David Vequist, head of the Center for Medical Tourism Research at the University of the Incarnate Word in Texas. “Consumer choice is a powerful force now in healthcare and is impacted by aging and increasingly heavier, sicker, and more needy populations in Asia.”   Medscape News web site has forecast medical tourism in Asia could generate $4.4 billion by 2012. The United States provides the most patients, as Americans travel abroad to avert the astronomical costs of having private treatment at home. Typically, Americans can save 40-50 percent. But there is a new patient on the operating table, and he or she is Chinese. Many of these patients are willing to spend what it takes to fix their problem. “No matter how expensive it is, I will go for it,” says Liu Xiao-yang, 34, of Shanghai, after having double-eyelid surgery, a facelift and corrective jaw surgery in Seoul. The rise of an affluent class in China, and an infatuation with so-called Hallyu, or Korean Wave, culture from pop music to drama have spurred a sharp growth in South Korean medical tourism, mainly in the field of cosmetic surgery. “Every time I watch South Korean drama and TV shows, I feel that they are pretty and I want to look like them,” says Liu. Kim Byung-gun, a plastic surgeon at the BK DongYang Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul, says his patients have ranged in age from 6, for double-eyelid procedure, to a 70-year-old seeking a skin lift. On average, they spend $5,000-$10,000 per procedure. “Medical tourism is going to be one of the growth engines of the South Korean economy,” Kim says, identifying the Korean Wave as a key contributor to the rapid growth of the sector in Asia’s fourth largest economy. South Korean authorities have every reason to be optimistic about the growth of the industry, particularly in the field of elective cosmetic surgery. CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in a study released last month estimated that China would account for 60 percent of the rise in high net-worth individuals’ wealth in Asia over the next five years. Chinese patients arrive in South Korea with photographs of Korean celebrities they want to look like, says Lee Soo-jung of the Lamar Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul. Han Dong-woo of the Korea Health Industry Development Institute says the number of tourists coming to South Korea ballooned last year to nearly 82,000, generating about $700 million in revenues. Three years earlier, fewer than 8,000 medical tourists travelled to South Korea. Han projects some 200,000 will come next year. By 2020, the South Korean government envisages a million medical tourists a year. “I see an infinite growth potential in the plastic surgery market for foreigners,” says Han, who estimates operation costs in South Korea are about half that of the United States. South Korea may be one of the fastest growing medical tourism destinations, but for now it lags far behind trailblazers Thailand, Singapore, India, Malaysia and even the Philippines. They all have their own distinctive marketing strategies in an attempt to woo clients, as well as areas of specialization. Thailand and India, Asia’s leading destinations, specialize in orthopedic and cardiac surgery. India’s government says its medical services are cheaper than those in southeast Asia, and identifies its English-speaking doctors as providing a “major comfort factor.”   It has even introduced a special visa category to cater for the growing number of medical tourists. Thailand sells itself as dual purpose destination where medical treatment can be combined with a cheap recuperative holiday. Bangkok was this year identified by TripIndex as the best value global city for U.S. travelers. The Singapore healthcare industry positions itself as a “premium” center. Among its patrons have been many of Malaysia’s sultans, as well as other high profile political figures and celebrities from Asia and the Middle East. By next year, Singapore aims to treat a million foreign patients a year, generating about $3 billion for the economy, the Singapore Straits Times has reported. Its area of expertise includes cancer treatments, cardiology and other specialized care. Like South Korea, it sees China, as well as India, as being the catalysts for growth,   Neighboring Malaysia, attracted nearly 400,000 medical tourists last year, and aims to increase that number to 1.9 million by 2020, mainly by way of undercutting Singapore. A health official said costs in Malaysia are 30 percent cheaper than the city-state to the south. The Philippines also sees itself as a cut-price destination, and is projecting the number of medical tourists to hit one million by 2015, generating at least $1 billion in revenue. It targets patients from the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Japan. “We can compete with the rest of Asia because we have an edge in providing high quality medical and dental services but at a much lower cost,” said Marie Recarro, an official at the Department of Tourism in Manila. Some experts, however, lament the rise of the medical tourism industry, saying it exacerbates a brain drain of talent from the state to the private system, from rural to urban areas. A paper published in the International Journal for Equity in Health last year said specialists were being swayed by the higher wages and better technology of the private sector. If the industry achieved even a fraction of its projected growth “this could ultimately lead to locals being priced out of their own health care system, as demand from foreign patients can drive up the costs of providing care for everyone,” it said. Experts cite other concerns such as medical errors, lax follow-up care, and insurance, regulatory and ethical issues. The World Health Organization said in a report late last year that rapid development of medical tourism had presented “considerable implications for public health.”   It said that with the influx of foreign patients, the demand for and price of healthcare might rise. “In addition, an increasing number of health services might cater for the needs of foreign patients and neglect local needs,” it said."," ",true,Health News

What's false: The child's name is Waylon, not Dakota, and the incident occurred back on 3 December 2016.",Dan Evon,"In December 2016, a message requesting that people pray for a young boy named Dakota who was allegedly airlifted to a hospital after having a seizure was widely circulated on Facebook: Although the verbiage of the message varied from post to post, all versions contained three basic elements — The boy’s name (Dakota), a short account of an emergency situation (he was airlifted to a hospital), and a call to action (please forward this message): Hey can you help get a prayer circle going for Dakota. They had to life flight him. He is having seizures. Forward this everywhere please. we need prayers for this little Boy please forward to all of your friends that prayers thank you This is a friend’s grandson Many of the messages, such as the one reproduced above, also included some note regarding a familial relation: Other messages were more specific and linked the prayer requests directly to another Facebook user. Those leads, however, also resulted in dead ends. Nearly every message about Dakota lacked credible information about where or when this incident occurred, but we did find a message posted to the prayer board of the Woodland Hills Baptist Church in Longview, Texas, which may have provided some additional details (i.e., the child’s full name and location) about the situation: Please pray for Dakota Wells. He is a child from Big Sandy  area … he is having continuous seizures and has been air lifted  to Dallas. Please pray for his healing … pray for his family and the Medical staff taking care of him. Thanks However, this information was inaccurate. Dakota Wells was not the name of the young boy who was airlifted to the hospital, but rather the name of the Facebook user who originally posted about the sick child. According to Wells, the young boy’s name is Waylon, her cousin, and he was airlifted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center on 3 December 2016:  A GoFundMe Page set up for Waylon Wells provided a little more information about the situation: Waylon was born Dec 3, 2016 son of Evan and Brandy Wells. He was airlifted to UMMC NICU within 3 hours of being born due to heart and lung complications. Prayers are being felt and greatly appreciated but the medical bills, gas and food expenses will be costly while Waylon is in the hospital. Any donation will be greatly appreciated!Help spread the word! Dakota Wells published pictures of Waylon being held by family members on 6 December 2016, three days after he was airlifted to the hospital. In early 2017, an update on his condition was published to the GoFundMe campaign’s page along with clarifications pertaining to social media rumors. Waylon was released from the hospital at the time the update was published, and”doing [great]”: I just wanted to update everyone on Waylon and clear up any misconceptions about his condition. Waylon does not nor did he ever have any seizures. He has Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening in his right heart muscle. Which he will always have to take medicine for. He will be able to live and function just like a normal child, no one will ever know anything is wrong with him just like a person that has diabetes if they don’t tell you, you wouldn’t know they had it. Waylon is doing GREAT! He has been home for almost 3 weeks now and is growing and developing as he should be. He sleeps and eats and is just a very content sweet baby boy. He will have routine monthly visits to his cardiologist for at least a year just to keep a check on his heart, all precautionary, he is otherwise a healthy boy! We are more Thankful for your prayers than we could ever express! I am not sure how Evan or myself would have gotten through those two weeks without all of you praying us through everything we were going through! Please continue to remember him in your daily prayers that he continues to grow strong and healthy! Thank y’all from the bottom of our hearts Although this prayer request most likely refers to Waylon Wells, the cousin of a “Dakota” Wells, it’s also possibly that this viral message refers to an incident in 2014, when a baby named Dakota when airlifted to a hospital in Bismarck.

The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain (""diseases of the musculoskeletal system"") and anxiety disorders (""mental disorders - other"") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality.",Steve Contorno,"Turning 40? Sen. Rand Paul says you can look forward to back pain in your near future, and maybe some anxiety. But don’t try to turn your ailments into a government check. At a breakfast event Wednesday, Jan. 14 in New Hampshire, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate spoke out against a public safety net that catches too many people who don’t need help. ""The thing is, all of these programs, there’s always somebody who’s deserving. (But) everybody in this room knows somebody who is gaming the system,"" Paul said. The proof? Look no further than the diagnoses landing people on disability, he added. ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. Join the club,"" he said to laughter. ""Who doesn’t get up a little anxious for work every day and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has a little back pain."" Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers. Identifying the problem The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month). The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older. The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out. After an audit of disability insurance in 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that  in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits). The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said. There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program. The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are ""hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination."" Back and anxiety Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports. Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under? Most back problems would fall under the category ""diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,"" the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, ""injuries,"" that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers. But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities. Anxiety would be included in ""mental disorders."" That category is broken down further as follows: As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by ""anxious,"" Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue. Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory ""mood disorders"" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders. Instead, people suffering from ""anxiety disorders"" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the ""other"" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent. For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with ""back pain,"" and every person with a ""mood disorder"" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in ""other"" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent. If you categorize anxiety correctly as ""other"" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent. And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments. There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues. That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous. But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers. Our ruling Paul said, ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain (""diseases of the musculoskeletal system"") and anxiety disorders (""mental disorders - other"") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality. We rate the statement .","https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/12.00-MentalDisorders-Adult.htm#12_02, http://gao.gov/assets/670/666830.pdf, https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/di_asr/2013/di_asr13.pdf, http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/staff-report_-how-some-legal-medical-and-judicial-professionals-abused-social-security-disability-programs-for-the-countrys-most-vulnerable-a-case-study-of-the-conn-law-firm, http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/656964.pdf, http://www.cato.org/blog/social-security-disability-benefits-unsustainable, https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/1.00-Musculoskeletal-Adult.htm#1_06, http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/, http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/01/15/rand_paul_over_half_on_disability_are_gaming_the_system.html, http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/321979.pdf",false,"National, Disability, Rand Paul, "
37627,People in Kansas have been jailed due to medical debt.,"February 10, 2020",Are Americans Getting Jailed for Unpaid Medical Debt?,"  Kim LaCapria  ","On February 10 2020, a story about people in Kansas being jailed over medical debt spread on Facebook and Reddit:""You wouldn’t think you’d go to jail over medical bills"": County in rural Kansas is jailing people over unpaid medical debt from newsA news story also gained traction on Reddit’s sister site Imgur in a related post contrasting two concurrent Reddit threads:The post shown here was the same r/news Reddit post linked above, itself pointing to a February 9 2020 CBS News article headlined, “‘You wouldn’t think you’d go to jail over medical bills’: County in rural Kansas is jailing people over unpaid medical debt.” CBS News and investigative nonprofit ProPublica reported on one family in Coffeyville, Kansas and their experience with mounting medical debt and, subsequently, jail time:Tres Biggs went to jail for failing to appear in court for unpaid medical bills. He described it as “scary.”“I was scared to death,” Tres Biggs said. “I’m a country kid — I had to strip down, get hosed and put a jumpsuit on.”Bail was $500. He said they had “maybe $50 to $100” at the time.In rural Coffeyville, Kansas, where the poverty rate is twice the national average, attorneys like Michael Hassenplug have built successful law practices representing medical providers to collect debt owed by their neighbors … That law was put in place at Hassenplug’s own recommendation to the local judge. The attorney uses that law by asking the court to direct people with unpaid medical bills to appear in court every three months and state they are too poor to pay in what is called a “debtors exam.”If two hearings are missed, the judge issues an arrest warrant for contempt of court. Bail is set at $500.Hassenplug said he gets “paid on what’s collected.” If the bail money is applied to the judgment, then he gets a portion of that, he said.Biggs was jailed after missing an appearance related to unpaid medical debt, thanks to a law put into place on the recommendation of attorney Michael Hassenplug. Hassenplug told CBS he is compensated in part through bail money collected in the course of hearings like the one Biggs reportedly missed.In the comments on Facebook, some users argued that the reported imprisonment was not directly due to medical debt, but for missed hearings:The headline is super mis-leading. NO ONE is going to jail for not paying their debt, medical or otherwise. They are going to jail when the Court enters an Order requiring them to show up in court and they don’t show up, in contempt of court.Biggs was originally the subject of a far larger, far more detailed investigation by ProPublica published in October 2019. That reporting provided extensive detail on medical debt court cases in Coffeyville, Kansas, the role of Hassenplug’s firm in it, and the unorthodox array of conditions enabling its existence in the first place. ProPublica reported that of the missed hearings, some “fell on days when [Biggs’ son] Lane had [leukemia] treatment, at a hospital in Tulsa, an hour south,” and that Biggs’ wife Heather refused to postpone their child’s cancer care:[A] warrant, [Biggs] learned at the jailhouse, was for failure to appear in court for an unpaid hospital bill. Coffeyville Regional Medical Center had sued him in 2006 for $2,146, after one of Heather’s emergency visits; neither of his jobs offered health insurance. In the shuffle of 70-hour workweeks and Lane’s chemotherapy, he had missed two consecutive court dates. He was fingerprinted, photographed, made to strip and told to brace himself for a tub of delousing liquid. His bail was set at $500 cash; he had about $50 to his name.His friend bailed him out the next morning, but at the bond hearing, the judge granted the $500, minus court fees, to the hospital. Biggs compensated his friend with a motorboat that a client had given him in exchange for a hunting dog. But it wasn’t long before the family received a new summons. In 2009, a radiologist represented by Hassenplug sued them for $380.The article included some background and ongoing information about the Biggs’ entire medical and financial picture, and that after his imprisonment, “Biggs was still on the hook for the bill that had landed him in jail; bail had covered only part of it, and the rest was growing with 12% annual interest.” Further, the hospital had garnished Biggs’ wages, and the radiologist had garnished his bank account, seizing contributions that his family had raised for Lane’s cancer treatment:By 2012, the Biggs family had accrued more than $70,000 in medical debt, which it owed to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and other hospitals, pediatricians and neurologists. Some forgave it; others set up lenient payment plans. Coffeyville’s was the only hospital that sued. The doctors who took them to court were represented by Hassenplug.ProPublica’s fourth paragraph began with an introduction to the presiding judge — a man without any legal background:Judge David Casement entered the courtroom, a black robe swaying over his cowboy boots and silversmithed belt buckle. He is a cattle rancher who was appointed a magistrate judge, though he’d never taken a course in law. Judges don’t need a law degree in Kansas, or many other states, to preside over cases like these.In 2017, The Atlantic reported that Kansas was one of a handful of states where judges like Casement “don’t need a law degree” in order to put defendants behind bars:Montana and seven other states — Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Wyoming — allow non-lawyer judges to hand down jail sentences for misdemeanors without the right to a new trial before a lawyer-judge. Some states, like Montana, only allow the practice in rural or sparsely populated counties, while others allow it statewide.The situation may have been acceptable in the 19th century, when lawyers and law schools were scarce, critics say. But in the modern era, they say it raises serious questions about due process and the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. “What’s the point of having a legally-trained lawyer if the judge can’t understand what they’re saying?” said Stuart Banner, a University of California Los Angeles law professor.Biggs was not the only medical debt sufferer featured in ProPublica’s story. In one excerpt, Hassenplug faced off against a young survivor of a suicide attempt, whose income of disability checks was exempt from the reach of the court and its orders:SEATED AT THE FRONT of the courtroom, Hassenplug zipped open his leather binder and uncapped his fountain pen. He is stout, with a pinkish nose and a helmet of salt and pepper hair. His opening case this Tuesday involved 28-year-old Kenneth Maggard, who owed more than $2,000, including interest and court fees, for a 40-mile ambulance ride [in 2018]. Maggard had downed most of a bottle of Purple Power Industrial Strength Cleaner, along with some 3M Super Duty Rubbing Compound, “to end it all.” His sister had called 911.Maggard took his seat. He had cropped red hair, pouchy cheeks and mud-caked sneakers. “The welfare patients are the most demanding, difficult patients on God’s earth,” Hassenplug told me, with Maggard listening, before launching into his interrogation: Are you working? No. Are you on disability? He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and anxiety. Do you have a car? No. Anyone owe you money you can collect? I wish.They had been here before, and they both knew Maggard’s disability checks were protected from collections. Hassenplug set down his pen. “Between you and me,” he asked, “you’re never going to pay this bill, are you?”“No, never,” Maggard said. “If I had the money, I’d pay it.”Hassenplug replied, “Well, this will end when one of us dies.”Another man jailed in the course of the court’s operations had no means to travel to the rural courthouse:Derek Dustman, who is 36 and works odd jobs, had been driving a four-wheeler when he was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital. Though he was sued for not paying his $818 ambulance bill, he didn’t have a license to drive to the courthouse. This spring [in 2019], he spent two nights in jail. “I never in a million years thought that this would end with jail time,” he told me.Much of the reporting concerned confusing or conflicting information provided by parties involved — such as Casement and Hassenplug — about the legal authority of debt collectors to influence decisions such as the issuance of a bench warrant or the imprisonment of any individual for inability to appear before the court or pay a medical debt. In one excerpt about a woman named Christa Strickland and her attempts to pay a 2008 bill for $2,514 (which had risen to $5,736 thanks in part to court fees by October 2019), ProPublica requested clarification from Account Recovery Specialists Inc. (ARSI) and from a lawyer named Amber Brehm.Lizzie Presser, who reported on the issue for the ProPublica, explained Strickland’s frantic attempts to avoid a bench warrant after missing a hearing by one day:When I asked ARSI about how attorneys decide to request warrants, Joshua Shea, who is general counsel, told me that they don’t. The judge can choose to issue one if court orders are not followed, he said. But Casement said the opposite, telling me that he gave the choice to the attorneys. “I’m not ordering a bench warrant. My decision is to give them that option,” Casement told me. “Whether they exercise it is up to them, but they have my blessing if that’s what they want to do.”Shea sent me an eight-page email to make clear, in large part, that ARSI, as a collection agency, has no involvement in the courts, and that Brehm is a lawyer whom the agency contractually employs and who represents the hospital directly. Her email address, though, has an ARSI domain, and her resume lists her as ARSI’s director of legal. Brehm said that court hearings aren’t the only option for debtors, who can call her instead and answer questions under oath. Shea said nobody — not the hospital, ARSI, Brehm or the court — uses the threat of jail to “extract payment.”Strickland reached Brehm after several days, and the attorney agreed to a new hearing. On Aug. 13 [2019], when they met in court, Brehm sat at the front of the room.“We’re giving you a second chance on that citation; just to try to take care of this without there having to be any sort of bench warrant,” [Brehm] said. “I want to make sure that we’re all on the same page about the consequences of not coming into court when the order has been issued.”Strickland nodded.“Again, if you set a payment plan and keep it,” Brehm said, “we won’t have to worry about that.”Slate.com’s What’s Next podcast covered the ProPublica report in October 2019, following with a transcript of the segment on February 10 2020.Other news outlets followed up on the way Coffeyville handles of medical debt in February 2020, independently confirming the ProPublica investigation, which (as we mentioned) was originally published in late 2019. CBS News reported that while their cameras were not permitted, only one of 60 medical debtors present on the day they visited had a lawyer with them:CBS News went to court on debt collection day. They wouldn’t allow our cameras in, but we watched more than 60 people swear they didn’t have enough money to pay, and only one of them had an attorney representing them.In related fact checks, the question of whether medical debt was the cause of bankruptcies emerged as a point of dispute in the same way that commenters argued people were jailed not over debt, but over missed court appearances. Semantic objections of that description seemed to be the only counterargument involved, since both instances involved otherwise accurate and verified claims.In February 2020, CBS News rehashed the findings of a late 2019 ProPublica investigation into people in Kansas jailed over medical debt, largely thanks to an unusual rural court system that was influenced by debt collection firms and lawyers. That investigation and subsequent interviews with lawyers and debt collectors involved confirmed the accuracy of the report — that people in Kansas were indeed jailed due to unpaid medical debt. A presiding judge said that lawyers had broad discretion, and that at least one victim reported missing hearings because they were taking their child to receive cancer treatments. None of the parties involved disputed that people were jailed over medical debt in various independent investigations.","https://www.truthorfiction.com/500000-americans-will-go-bankrupt-this-year-from-medical-bills/, https://www.wlsam.com/2020/02/10/rural-kansas-country-sends-people-to-jail-over-unpaid-medical-bills/, https://www.reddit.com/r/news/, https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2019/10/what-next-and-lizzie-presser-of-propublica-on-the-harsh-consequences-of-medical-debt, https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/when-your-judge-isnt-a-lawyer/515568/, https://slate.com/transcripts/SWRwQUhnZEFiZ01ZNlVVeEZJMnYxM3UycVFBeFpjcXhYY1QzUTFqbm0xcz0=, https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fare-americans-getting-jailed-for-unpaid-medical-debt%2F, https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fare-americans-getting-jailed-for-unpaid-medical-debt%2F, https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/f1jie5/you_wouldnt_think_youd_go_to_jail_over_medical/?ref_source=embed&ref=share, https://www.facebook.com/WIBWTV/posts/10157404881804440, https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fare-americans-getting-jailed-for-unpaid-medical-debt%2F, https://i.imgur.com/MwFPxoD.jpg, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/, https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/f1jie5/you_wouldnt_think_youd_go_to_jail_over_medical/, https://imgur.com/gallery/8b6Wo4t, https://www.truthorfiction.com/author/kim/, https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fare-americans-getting-jailed-for-unpaid-medical-debt%2F, https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Are+Americans+Getting+Jailed+for+Unpaid+Medical+Debt%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fare-americans-getting-jailed-for-unpaid-medical-debt%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https://www.ezoic.com/what-is-ezoic/, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coffeyville-kansas-medical-debt-county-in-rural-kansas-is-jailing-people-over-unpaid-medical-debt/, https://features.propublica.org/medical-debt/when-medical-debt-collectors-decide-who-gets-arrested-coffeyville-kansas/, https://www.wibw.com/content/news/County-in-rural-Kansas-is-jailing-people-over-unpaid-medical-debt-567727951.html, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/viral-content/",true,"Fact Checks, Viral Content"
4895,Chicago teachers’ contract talks about more than money.,,"Chicago’s public schools will be closed Thursday as the city’s 25,000 teachers are set to go on strike . A strike in the nation’s third-largest school district would mean no classes for more than 300,000 students. Like most workers threatening to walk off the job, the teachers want a raise. But money is only part of the story."," Don Babwin","Here are some of the issues behind the school district’s second strike in seven years: WHAT KIND OF MONEY ARE THE TEACHERS LOOKING FOR AND WHAT KIND OF RAISE IS THE CITY OFFERING? The city has offered 16% raises for the teachers over a five-year contract and calls for the teachers’ health care costs not to increase for three years. The city says that’s a pretty good deal for teachers, whose starting annual salary of just under $53,000 is higher than the salary for teachers in any other school district in the state. But the union, which is asking for a 15% raise over three years, says its analysis shows teachers at the end of the contract will make about $15,000 less than the city says they will. The union also said the contract leaves unclear just how much health care costs will increase during the final two years. WHY DON’T TEACHERS JUST TAKE THE MONEY? At first blush, it seems like a pretty good deal: a 16% raise over five years. But the teachers’ union sees a potential trap. Teachers say if they take the raise, they lose negotiating leverage as they demand more school nurses, social workers, librarians and smaller classrooms because those are not the kinds of things they can legally strike over. The union knows about the city’s vow to add at least 200 social worker positions and at least 250 full-time nurse positions but has made it clear that the only way to make sure the city follows through on its promises is to put it in writing in the next contract. WHY NOT JUST INCLUDE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS IN THE CONTRACT? Until this week, the city wanted nothing to do with adding staffing requirements to the collective bargaining agreement, saying it would make it tougher for principals to run their individual schools because it would require them to use a chunk of their budgets to fill those positions at the expense of the “needs and desires of the local community or school.” But this week the CPS and city announced a willingness to write into the contract language that would address class sizes and staffing issues. That’s potentially good news to the union, which has made it clear that any deal must address staffing shortages and overcrowded classrooms. JUST HOW CROWDED ARE THE CLASSES? It depends on who you ask. The school district contends that 80% of the kindergarten to third-grade classes made the 28-student maximum and 90% of the fourth- to eighth-grade classes met the 31-student maximum. The union estimates that a quarter of the city’s elementary school students are in overcrowded classrooms. That disagreement is partly why the union wants a contract provision that calls for teachers to receive an extra $5 a day per student whenever their classes exceed the mandated size limit. The union also is pushing for smaller class sizes. The district says that would require the hiring of another 1,150 teachers and 1,000 teacher assistants at a cost of at least $225 million annually. WHY ARE NURSES, LIBRARIANS, SOCIAL WORKERS, AND COUNSELORS SUCH A STICKING POINT? There is no disputing the fact that the school district needs more people on those jobs. According to the union, about one-fifth of the district-run schools have librarians. And as scarce as they are citywide, the union says they are even harder to find in schools where most students are black. As for nurses, both the union and the school district agree many more are needed, though they can’t agree on how many are currently working in the district. The union wants contract language that spells out that people will only be asked to do the jobs for which they are hired. It also has expressed concern about the number of students currently assigned to counselors and about various roles counselors are expected to fill, including as substitute teachers and lunchroom help. WHAT IS THE DEBATE OVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOUT? Chicago is an expensive place to live and the way the union sees it, too expensive for some teachers and way too expensive for teaching assistants, clerks and other support staff. Like other city employees, teachers are required to live in Chicago and the union said that if police officers and firefighters receive housing subsidies, they should also get them. They want language in the contract that would call for the school district to provide housing assistance for new teachers and others, and to help students’ families who are at risk of losing their housing. Mayor Lori Lightfoot agrees affordable housing is an important issue but a collective bargaining agreement between the teachers and the city isn’t the place to solve it.","/fe67b0cad7a94047a50c4bc21d9b82d1,/tag/ChicagoSchools",true,"Chicago, Health, General News, Strikes, U.S. News, Chicago Schools"
9634,Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial,"May 20, 2016","This is a brief story on findings from a phase II trial of a new oral insulin medication conducted by Oramed, a pharmaceutical company. The story gives us the basics on the study design and findings. It’s made clear that the drug must undergo further testing before it’s approved for use. The only commentary, though, was from the CEO. Given the nature of the research–unpublished and coming directly from a pharmaceutical company–an outside source would have made this story stronger. (We also reviewed the news release this story seems to be based on.) The worldwide occurrence of diabetes is about 400 million people, 90 percent of whom have type II diabetes. Many of these people eventually have to supplement their oral medications with injected insulin. Previously, oral delivery of insulin was considered impossible because the drug degrades in the digestive system, but Oramed believes they have overcome this problem.","A'ndrea Elyse Messer, MS, PhD,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Joy Victory","A comparison of cost to currently available long-acting insulin would have been informative, but the report is on a trial for safety and efficacy, so this is preliminary. The story reports a decrease in “mean night-time glucose of nearly 6.5 percent” compared with a placebo. However, there is no indication of what that means for control of type II diabetes–absolute numbers are needed to be useful. The difference appears to be small and similar to what already-available oral medications can do. It’s also not clear if these patients continued to take metformin or not. This story states that there were “no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar.” The story tells us this was a randomly chosen, blinded study of 180 people over 28 days, and considered a Phase II trial. The story also mentions that stage III trials still need to be done, which is when the drug might be considered for approval. These are important details. But, because it’s an unpublished study, no one outside of the company has taken a look at the evidence. This story should have had a stronger signal that this is potentially straying from the realm of science and into marketing. Type II diabetes is a known disease of the industrial world and the numbers of people are increasing while the ages at which they are diagnosed is decreasing. An oral insulin would aid people in controlling their blood sugar levels. The story includes comments from the CEO. Getting an independent voice is especially important when the data is preliminary and comes from the pharmaceutical company. The story does say that this drug is intended for those for whom metformin, a standard treatment for type II diabetes, is no longer sufficient. But because there are many alternatives for diabetes management, and none were mentioned, this is Not Satisfactory. The story makes it clear that the drug needs more research before it will be reviewed by the FDA for approval. The story makes it clear that if this drug delivers the necessary insulin by mouth, then this would be a novel advance in treatment–and a “multibillion-dollar product.” Because the story contains original quotes not found in the news release, this squeaks by as Satisfactory. It is clear, however, that this story is being published because of promotional outreach by the company, and the lack of outside perspective makes this feel more like a news release than a piece of journalism.

11603,FDA approves Epclusa for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus infection,"July 6, 2016","This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV. The tablet combines an existing drug, sofosbuvir, with a new drug, velpatasvir, and is the first single therapy for all six major forms of the virus. Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments. The release informs on the novelty, harms and benefits of the drug but doesn’t give reporters — or lay readers — much background on the clinical trials that led to the approval. An estimated 120 million people have HCV infections worldwide, with an upper estimate of 3.9 million in the US alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new treatment — Epclusa — has an estimated cost of about $74,800 per 12-week necessary therapy length — or about $900 per pill. But without treatment, many HCV patients may require years of treatment and suffer damage to their livers that require transplants and could ultimately be more expensive. The economics of new drugs is a vital part of any story about the drugs. We wish this release had included some context on the cost issues surrounding HCV infection for both patients and the society at large. A blogger with Bloomberg News focused a post about the drug pricing which has been controversial due to the millions of patients affected.","Sally James,A'ndrea Elyse Messer, MS, PhD,Kathlyn Stone","The release does not discuss cost. The FDA evaluates drugs without consideration of cost, so it’s understandable that they wouldn’t comment on it — and that’s why we’re rating this Not Applicable. We look forward to the day when any news release about a new drug — even one from the FDA — includes some mention of cost in its message. After all, the value of a new drug is a function not just of how well it works, but its cost-effectiveness. The release includes results from Phase III clinical trials in about 1,600 patients showing a benefit. “Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured.” The release also notes that after 12 weeks, 94 percent of patients with more advanced disease who received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin showed no virus in their blood. The release notes that the most common side effects of Epclusa are headache and fatigue. It also explains that Epclusa carries a warning that “serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral.” The FDA also warns that certain drugs may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which would reduce its effectiveness. The release does not use the important words “randomized controlled” that would signal to the reader about the quality of the evidence. The release also does not give us the precise size of cohorts, or even tell us where to get further details with a journal citation, URL or a link. The FDA also missed an opportunity to inform readers about limitations of these studies and gaps in our knowledge related to these medications. For example, these were short-term studies, and so we don’t yet know whether these patients will have fewer cases of liver cancer, liver failure, or need for liver transplants down the line. That’s an educated inference based on the drug’s ability to eradicate the virus — but not proven. There is no disease mongering. The release did not identify funding sources or state whether there were any conflicts of interest.This release describes the approval of a new drug by a regulatory agency, but we’d still like to know who sponsored the study that’s the basis for the approval. It’s not enough to state who manufactures and markets the drug. The release explains in some detail that different HCV patients may follow different drug regimens, depending on their particular strain of virus and other characteristics of their infection. A bit more explanation about how patients and providers may choose whether to use Epclusa or other alternatives and how they will compare would have been helpful. The release is announcing the approval of the drug which usually means it will be available in the near future. The release states that this is a wholly new combination drug that has not been available until this approval by the FDA. It also states that it is the first drug that works for all six strains of the virus. There was no unjustifiable language.","https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hepc.jpg,http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#section1,http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-06-29/gilead-epclusa-price-a-sign-of-industry-change",true,Government agency news release
22663,"Lorraine Fende Says that in Ohio ""right now, you could be 8½ months pregnant and have an abortion for no reason.","February 4, 2011",Rep. Lorraine Fende on point that abortion at 8 1/2 months is legal,Joe Guillen,"A new bill to ban late-term abortions is gaining traction in the Ohio House of Representatives, reinvigorating debate over the state’s abortion laws. If passed, the bill would ban abortions when a woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant and tests show the fetus can live outside the womb – a condition known as being viable. The proposed ban contains exceptions for certain medical situations, a legal requirement for late-term abortion bans at the state level. The proposed ban is one of three bills related to abortion the Republican majority in the House introduced this week. The set of abortion bills comes on the heels of similar legislation Democratic Rep. Lorraine Fende of Willowick introduced earlier this year. Fende’s bill aimed to ban abortions when a woman is at least 22 weeks pregnant with a viable fetus. Fende’s bill is likely going nowhere now that Republicans have trumped her proposal with one of their own. But a case she made for her bill – involving the availability of late-term abortions in Ohio – also is central to Republicans’ plan to ban late-term abortions. ""I had a conversation with someone quite some time ago that right now, you could be 8½ months’ pregnant and have an abortion for no reason,"" Fende told The Columbus Dispatch for a story published Jan. 17. Similarly, proponents of Republicans’ plan to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy decried the occurrence of abortions in Ohio up to the ninth month of pregnancy. While advocates and opponents of the proposed ban on late-term abortions prepare to debate this sensitive issue as it moves through the legislature, it is important to keep the facts straight. So we decided to check out Fende’s claim. Fende said she relied on statistics from the Ohio Department of Health. Doctors who perform an abortion in Ohio must submit to the department a Confidential Abortion Report, which does not include the woman’s name or other identifying information. According to the Ohio Department of Health, four abortions were performed in Ohio after 32 weeks (or eight months) of pregnancy in 2009, the most recent year in which statistics are available. Two abortions were performed when the mother was 32 weeks along; one abortion took place at 33 weeks; and one occurred at 35 weeks. Overall, 28,721 abortions were reported in Ohio in 2009. Of those, 613 involved pregnancies at least 20 weeks along and 116 of them were for women at least 24 weeks pregnant. The length of the pregnancy was unknown in 276 cases. The numbers confirm that at least one abortion occurred in Ohio when a mother was at least 8½ months’ pregnant. Fende said she was aware of this one abortion when she made her claim, and she said she did not know the reason behind it. Ohio law does not include an absolute ban on abortions when a woman is 8½, 8¾ or even 9 months’ pregnant. State lawmakers tried to pass a late-term abortion ban in 1995, but the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban was unconstitutional because medical exceptions to the ban were not sufficiently specific. Courts, however, have upheld Ohio’s a ban on partial-birth abortions, which are performed after part of the fetus has been removed from the mother’s body. Partial-birth abortion is associated with late-term pregnancy but the two are not mutually exclusive. There are other abortion procedures, permitted under Ohio law, that can terminate a late-term pregnancy. Although certain late-term abortions are legal, pro-choice advocates say they are only done for medical reasons – not for ""no reason,"" as Fende suggested. Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said abortion clinics in the state will not perform an abortion if the woman has been pregnant for at least 24 weeks. She said any abortion performed afterward would take place in a hospital for medical reasons. Jessie Hill, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said abortions when a woman is 8½ months pregnant don’t happen in Ohio for no reason. ""It’s just one of those things that’s unheard of,"" said Hill, who has researched reproductive rights. Hill said she is pro-choice. Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said that most abortion clinics advertise for abortions at 24 weeks or earlier. But, Gonidakis pointed out, statistics from the Ohio Department of Health show abortions are happening beyond 24 weeks. The statistics do not show whether the abortions are taking place in a hospital or an abortion clinic. But, upon request from the Democrats for Life of Ohio, the Department of Health provided data on the medical condition of women receiving an abortion after they had been pregnant for at least 23 weeks. The data was taken from the abortion reports doctors submitted to the department. The report includes a question about the patient’s medical condition, whether it was ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""other."" Of the 116 abortions in 2009 performed when the woman was reported to be 24 weeks pregnant or more, all of them were listed in good medical condition, according to the Department of Health. So where does this leave us? The law does not explicitly outlaw such an abortion, but state health records show there was just one such case in 2009, and Fende said she did not have the background of that case. And a law professor who is an expert in reproductive rights told us that abortions at 8½ months aren't done for just ""no reason."" Fende’s claim was legally sound. But by itself it does not reflect what the state Department of Health is documenting. That there was just one case out of more than 28,700 abortions in 2009 that fits her statement is an additional piece of information needed to fully understand the claim.

11471,"To Inspect the Heart, Some Doctors Now Start at the Wrist","September 22, 2009","This is an engaging and important enterprise story that explained a number of important issues to be factored in when considering medical interventions. It also nicely highlights the tension that exists in the development of new and presumably less invasive approaches to cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. It’s refreshing to still find 1,600-word stories that go into such detail. It is clear from the story that:  Cardiologists are not of one mind about the value or benefit of doing cardiac catheterizations thorugh the radial artery in the wrist as opposed to the femoral artery in the groin. Different physicians value patient comfort differently. Different physicians may be more comfortable with, and better with, certain procedures. However what was lacking from this story was an examination of the overall success rate of the intended procedure. While patient comfort surely has value, procedure outcome is vital. We never learned any data about whether the actual goal of opening an artery is any better one way or another. Interestingly, the cited meta analysis is only partially acknowledged. While a trend was noted toward an advantage to the radial artery approach (in terms of bleeding and procedural outcome), the authors concluded a large randomized trial is necessary to determine the true value of the approach. And that wasn’t mentioned in the story. Overall, though, the story delivers a clear picture of why patients need to have conversations with their caregivers about the risks and benefits of the various options available for their treatment. Being aware that there is often not a single answer to questions about the course of action is an important step towards making decisions that will get you the care that is best for you. The online version also included helpful graphics and a video."," ","The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an ""expensive overnight hospital stay"" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time. But the story didn’t include any specific cost information about this new approach. Shouldn’t the physicians interviewed know whether their charge to patients depends on the vessel used? Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The benefit of the treatment was presented in terms of patient comfort and time, and presented quantitative information indicating the radial approach results in a reduction in bleeding complications as compared with the femoral artery. But it did not provide any data about the outcomes of the procedure, namely, ""How did it do in opening arteries?"" It is interesting to note that the meta-analysis cited in the story concluded that additional studies are needed to better define the role of this approach, which was not mentioned in the story. The story mentioned that arterial spasms tops the list of complications with this procedure and indicated that it was particularly problematic in ""little old ladies."" Beyond this, the story did not give the reader any idea of how common this sort of problem was, making it difficult for readers to evaluate. The story did an incomplete job of including relevant evidence about the use of the radial artery for coronary catheterization. Since the  cardiac cath and angioplasty is intended to relieve symptoms by unblocking a coronary artery, it would have been helpful to have commented on the literature on outcome differences between the two approaches. The story implies an equal outcome with less risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations; both positive from the patient’s perspective. Without any comment on the outcome of the cath and angioplasty, patients cannot place a value on the radial approach. The story touched on the notion that there was a steep learning curve in order to develop proficiency using the radial insertion site. But there was both insufficient information for potential patients to use to assess whether the clinician they were consulting had adequate experience and what the ramifications of using this site without adequate experience might be. The story did not engage in disease mongering. The story included interview material from clinicians who utilize this technique only rarely as well as those who rely on it extensively. In addition, there were several patient quotes that presented the view from the other side of the table. While there was no discussion about the appropriate use of cardiac catheterization in general, the story included information about the two arterial routes that may be used for the procedure. The story indicated that radial catheterization is most likely not routinely available and that a low percentage (1%) of catheterizations are performed this way. The story did a good job placing the novelty of the approach into context. Reading the various physicians’ experiences with this technique, it is clear that it is not novel and yet is also not commonly utilized. Clearly, the story did not rely on a news release."," ",true," "
